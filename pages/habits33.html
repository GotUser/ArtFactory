                                Introduction
                            </a></p>
                        <p>Ever wonder why getting ahead can sometimes seem like such a struggle? The truth is: If you
                            want to be highly
                            successful, you need to be highly disciplined. I've polled countless executives and
                            entrepreneurs about the
                            things they're doing every day which and typically they credit simple daily routines which
                            have been proven
                            over time to give them an edge.


                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">1. Read about your industry and beyond.</a></p>



                        <p>"I spend an hour, usually after dinner, reading about my industry, related industries,
                            current events and pop
                            culture. I start with daily curation emails like Jason Hirschhorn's REDEF series and then
                            branch out. I
                            bookmark and tag (first with Delicious, now with Evernote) posts that I like and might refer
                            to later. When
                            possible, I share these posts, along with a brief summary of my rationale for sharing, with
                            my team or
                            friends. If nothing else, this process helps me remember the salient parts of the post and
                            gives me time to
                            explore how they fit into my larger view of things. This is my version of something Alvin
                            Toffler wrote
                            about that likened our world view to a filing cabinet in our brains; whenever new
                            information gets presented
                            to us, we catalogue and file it and then it goes on to inform our worldview in some small
                            way. There's
                            tremendous power and opportunity in understanding how seemingly unrelated trends and events
                            will go on to
                            affect the work you're doing."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">2. Keep a daily journal, but do it the right way.</a>
                        </p>


                        <p>"Most people use their journal to record events or to vent. But there's so much more you can
                            do with your
                            journal and get immediate results in your life. Use your journal to write what you want your
                            life to be. For
                            years I've kept a journal to chronicle my life, plan for my dreams and strategize my goals.
                            It is one of the
                            important success habits that I do daily. Journaling empowers me to take my ideas and turn
                            them into
                            reality. What's written is real. Once the words and images hit the paper, you have now
                            crystallized a
                            thought or idea. You can use the power of pen and paper to strategize and create anything
                            you want.
                            Journaling is one of the best methods of self-care therapy. When you're journaling
                            consistently, you tend to
                            ask questions about life, your direction&nbsp;and&nbsp;your business."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">3. Work out for a strong body, which holds up a strong
                                mind.</a></p>



                        <p>"Successful entrepreneurship requires more than just mental fitness, it requires physical
                            fitness as well. I
                            have a daily workout regime that started in 2013 and has grown and evolved in step with our
                            business. It
                            started with CrossFit (high intensity interval type training) and has expanded from there.
                            Clearing your
                            mind and challenging yourself physically with a tough workout every day prepares you for the
                            daily
                            challenges of business. A strong body holds up a strong mind."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">4. Remove fear.</a></p>


                        <p>"I find when working with others, when we seem to reach a barrier to getting something done,
                            the barrier is
                            really about their fear of failure, fear of being blamed, fear of accountability, etc. This
                            fear is rooted
                            in their prior experiences with another boss, another colleague, or even a family member.
                            What I've learned
                            is that if I tell them 'I'm in this with you, and if this heads south I'll accept as much or
                            more
                            responsibility for that than anybody,' we can get beyond that fear and become extremely
                            productive."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">5. Unplug without a device.</a></p>


                        <p>"Time away from the digital world is critical for my sanity, productivity and general
                            wellness. Late night
                            walks along the ocean without my phone provides a tranquil way to get exercise, digest the
                            day, plan the
                            next day and enjoy nature."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">6. Check your pride at the door.</a></p>


                        <p>"Great leaders understand that they are not the best at everything, but rather realizing
                            their greatest asset
                            is deciphering valuable information and how to action it quickly. Business owners have to be
                            able to make
                            tough decisions, but they need good reliable facts. Leaders who listen to their teams come
                            out ahead and
                            complete a better execution vs. leaders who only believe their way is always the right way.
                        </p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">7. Never give up.</a></p>


                        <p>"My daughter would say my favorite saying is 'Never give up!' It sounds trivial, but there
                            are so many times
                            that if I accepted 'No,' I would not have moved along the pendulum. It's a delicate dance of
                            fortitude,
                            polite aggression and compartmentalized fear. Sometimes you just have to hit at it from a
                            different angle. I
                            often conceptualize chipping away at the wall. Different angles, different tools and a
                            little muscle. Rarely
                            you get the answer you want out of the gate and often times through the process you find you
                            need to adjust
                            your approach, but the end goal always the same."</p>




                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">8. Surround yourself with positive people.</a></p>



                        <p>"Social media has become a cesspool for the haters and trolls. Don't let negative people hold
                            you back.
                            Understand that negativity generally comes from unhappy people and those who envy you. Happy
                            successful
                            people don't tear others down. Surround yourself with ambitious, positive people. It's too
                            easy to focus on
                            the negative and there's just no upside to that."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">9. Listen and learn.</a></p>


                        <p>"Listen to your peers, employees and customers. &nbsp;You will always learn something from
                            listening. &nbsp;I
                            also find that it could facilitate relationships just by listening, and really let people
                            feel that you
                            care. &nbsp;It helps ease any tensions, even if it doesn't immediately solve a problem, it
                            could relieve any
                            negative feelings just by letting people express themselves whether it be an unhappy
                            customer, a stressed
                            employee or colleague."</p>




                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">10. Put in extra effort to stay organized.</a></p>



                        <p>"Making lists and setting daily goals helps us stay focused each day. There are so many fires
                            to put out each
                            day when you own your own business and working to stay organized and task oriented helps us
                            stay on track
                            and meet our goals. We also have planning meetings to map out our vision and goals for the
                            next six and 12
                            months. This helps us focus on the big picture of growing a new business and measure our
                            success and
                            failures over the year."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">11. Pay attention to details.</a></p>


                        <p>"Refuse to cut any corners when it comes to ingredients or any aspect of the manufacturing
                            process. While
                            many have told me that my attention to detail is counterproductive, I feel that it has been
                            very helpful
                            with growing sales and ultimately earning customer confidence. Basically, I have depended
                            upon my inner
                            voice regardless of trends and well-intentioned advice that did not feel right to me. Go
                            with your gut and
                            don't deviate from your brand's mission."</p>




                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">12. Keep some balance in your life.</a></p>


                        <p>"If you let your work consume you, it will. Pushing away from the laptop and cell phone for a
                            break each day
                            is critical. It's not always easy when you're chasing a deadline. Small distractions,
                            however, can have an
                            incredibly refreshing effect. Inject a little daily balance into your life--dinner with the
                            family, an hour
                            of exercise, going to see my child participate in an extracurricular activities or 30
                            minutes with a book or
                            newspaper."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">13. Write down your gratitude.</a></p>


                        <p>"First thing when I wake up, I write down three things I have to be grateful for, three
                            things that would
                            make that day great, and one daily affirmation. Right before I go to sleep, I write down
                            three amazing
                            things that happened that day and answer the question: 'How could I have made today better?'
                            The daily
                            practice of writing down what I have to be grateful for, and reflecting upon who I want to
                            become, helps me
                            rewire my brain and improve my happiness."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">14. Deprioritize opportunities which don't fit with
                                your goals.</a></p>


                        <p>I force
                            myself to down-prioritise them or even
                            say 'no.'&nbsp;Keep your focus and move on to more productive tasks. Learn from the
                            experience that you
                            cannot do it all. Once the butter is spread too thin, it is difficult to go back."</p>




                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">15. Adapt to what the present holds.</a></p>


                        <p>"Here's a quote that I repeat often to myself :&nbsp;'In the midst of chaos, there is also
                            opportunity.' It keeps me
                            focused, knowing that
                            even in moments when it all looks and feels like chaos, I am moving forward, I am looking
                            for solutions,
                            that may open new doors with endless&nbsp;possibilities. It reminds me to be flexible and
                            adapt to what the
                            present holds."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">16. Pick three things to do each day.</a></p>


                        <p>"Running a business can be quite overwhelming, with the work truly never ending. When you
                            have a lot to do,
                            my philosophy is to just pick 3 things to do each day. Do those three things first in the
                            morning, and then
                            wherever the rest of your day takes you, you know at least you're progressing and have
                            accomplished what you
                            needed to."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">17. Start the day with a small, meaningful win.</a>
                        </p>



                        <p>"I start almost every day by talking to one of our customers. On Sunday night I spend about
                            30 minutes lining
                            up informal calls for the week, and use my 20-minute drive to work to have those
                            conversations. Jumping on
                            the phone and hearing first hand what's working for them, their frustrations, and just how
                            hard they're
                            hustling gives me motivation to help them be as successful as possible. I try to carry their
                            passion through
                            the rest of my day. When the day starts with a small win, the momentum continues."</p>




                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">18. Use Sundays to plan out your week.</a></p>


                        <p>"Between today's hyperactive communication landscape and the nonstop news cycle, it can be
                            hard to stay
                            focused, which is why I plan my week out before it starts. Every Sunday I spend time on
                            Evernote walking
                            through a regimented process of what I want to accomplish in the coming week, making sure it
                            aligns with
                            monthly, quarterly, and annual goals. Sure, fire drills come up and to-do lists change, but
                            this approach to
                            planning keeps me focused across different functions so that I can be as strategic as
                            possible in my
                            day-to-day."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">19. Protect your Sunday nights.</a></p>



                        <p>"I have a post-it up in my kitchen that says, 'Sunday is not a workday, so back off
                            anticipatory brain!' I
                            have to consciously force myself to protect the empty space and recovery time. Having a
                            small visual
                            reminder gives my subconscious permission to wait until Monday morning to start working
                            again. This is about
                            recovery and time with family but it's also about creating blank space in your head so new
                            ideas can pop
                            up."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">20. Make a list of goals for improvement.</a></p>


                        <p>"I keep a running list of goals for improvement in the back of my daily notebook. It makes me
                            more conscious
                            of where I can do better. Before major meetings and presentations, I run through the list to
                            make sure I've
                            internalized relevant points, and afterwards I'll run through any feedback with my
                            co-founder or, if
                            available, watch a recording of the presentation to add new goals to the list."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">21. Walk while talking on the phone.</a></p>


                        <p>"Walking around the neighborhood while I'm on even the most important phone calls is key to
                            energizing me and
                            being a creative problem solver in the moment. I'm sure there's some physiological science
                            behind it (hence
                            walking desks), but walking outside and talking is key to keeping me sane during the day. It
                            also helps
                            being in El Segundo and having plenty of parks and neighborhoods to stroll through."</p>






                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">22. Accept that one amazing thing will happen every
                                day.</a></p>


                        <p>"When I wake up in the morning, I remind myself that no matter how impossible things seem,
                            there's going to
                            be at least one really awesome and unexpected thing that's going to happen that day. This
                            really helps me
                            get going, and 99 percent of the time, it turns out to be true."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">23. Start your day with meditation.</a></p>


                        <p>"I've been meditating for a few years now, first thing after waking up each morning. It's
                            made a huge
                            difference to me and to the people around me. Focusing on your breathing, just for 10 to 15
                            minutes in the
                            morning gets you into a mindset where you're better able to step back from the thoughts and
                            emotions that
                            might cloud your thinking. Through mindfulness, you are able to approach situations with
                            much more clarity
                            to better focus on what's really important and prioritize your time accordingly, both
                            professionally and
                            personally."</p>




                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">24. Walk in the park.</a></p>



                        <p>"To achieve better mental clarity, I try to go for a 30-minute walk in the park near my house
                            every day. I
                            find that taking that period to be outside by myself allows me to quiet my mind, organize my
                            thoughts and
                            find ways to approach different situations more objectively. I'm able to visualize the
                            bigger picture
                            associated with the big decisions I need to make professionally and personally, and
                            ultimately, I'm better
                            able to determine the correct course of action."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">25. Think like a customer.</a></p>


                        <p>"I try to approach our daily brainstorming sessions from the perspectives of our customers. I
                            encourage my
                            team to join me in coming to these meetings with a list of recent customer reviews and
                            feedback to help us
                            keep our customers top of mind as we develop new collections and work to constantly improve
                            the shopping
                            experience. This helps our entire team stay laser-focused and removes our egos from the
                            mix."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">26. Invert the traditional working hierarchy.</a></p>



                        <p>"Every day as I interact with the team that reports to me, I actively and continually invert
                            the traditional
                            organizational structure. Instead of asking what they can do for me, I instead ask what I
                            can do for them.
                            As CEO, I view my role as making my general managers successful, not the other way around. I
                            try to remove
                            obstacles, reduce friction, give them better tools and impart guidance. Anything that frees
                            them up to
                            deliver bigger and better results, which in turn, helps create a better company. I have for
                            a long time
                            believed that the ego is the number one destroyer of companies, and I have seen many
                            examples of this in
                            action. So, long ago, I decided to check my ego in at the proverbial front door and instead
                            approach my
                            leadership role as one of making divisional leaders as successful as possible. And that has
                            seemed to have
                            made a material difference."</p>





                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">27. Let music influence your mood.</a></p>


                        <p>"When I'm in the car to and from work each day, I blare my music and make sure to sing along
                            with whoever I'm
                            listening to. Great way to gear up for the day or wind down after a particularly long one.
                            Only downside is
                            that it gets a bit awkward at a red light when you catch the next car staring at you while
                            you're belting
                            out to Ed Sheeran."</p>




                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">28. Create a sense of calm.</a></p>


                        <p>"Creating a sense of calm each day helps me to set goals, prioritize and reflect. Whether
                            this means waking
                            up early for a yoga class or practicing breathing and meditation on my morning commute, I
                            have found that
                            even five minutes can make a difference. This habit has allowed me to be more engaged,
                            thoughtful and
                            ultimately make better decisions in both my work and personal life."</p>



                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">29. Make time for music.</a></p>



                        <p>"I listen to music every day. Not all day, just two songs minimum--one familiar and one
                            random. One of the
                            first things I do when I get out of bed in the morning is play one song I know will have a
                            positive effect
                            on me. This gets me going and puts me in the right mindset for the day. Then I'll play at
                            least one random
                            song on my commute. Sometimes I get one I love or haven't heard for years, sometimes I get
                            neither. The
                            variable reward not only keeps me coming back, but is exciting. For me, music has noticeable
                            and powerful
                            effects on my brain. It&nbsp;changes my mood, motivates me, and boosts my concentration."

                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">30. Give yourself time to relax.&nbsp;</a></p>


                        <p>"Take an hour at the end of every day to decompress and unwind. Not only will you get to
                            relieve the day's
                            stress, but you'll give yourself the chance to really absorb everything you learned during
                            the day and
                            evaluate your next steps. Entrepreneurs - myself included - tend to be workaholics, but it's
                            important to
                            take a break from the grind and let yourself breathe. Your business can only be in good
                            shape if you are,
                            too.</p>


                        <p></p>


                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">31. Tell the future you what to do.</a></p>


                        <p>"Increase productivity by allowing yourself to focus on the task at hand. An effective way to
                            do this is by
                            splitting your time into two categories: 1) telling yourself what to do, and 2) doing what
                            you tell yourself
                            to do. I use my calendar, email, and a to-do list on the wall to tell future me what to work
                            on. Before the
                            end of every day, I make sure it's updated so that when I get to my office in the morning I
                            know exactly
                            what I need to do."</p>

                        </p>


                        <p>"It's easy to sometimes get trapped in monotonous work or life patterns which can affect your
                            mood and
                            overall performance. When that happens, read something uplifting. If I'm dragging or feeling
                            uninspired, I
                            try to reset my attitude by reading a book that I find inspiring to give me a boost or just
                            break the cycle
                            of scheduled sameness."</p>


                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">33. Move your body.</a></p>


                        <p>"Literally move your body, whether it's taking time to work out or a quick walk around the

                            I'm more bookish than athletic, but as I've had to learn to manage myself along with my
                            business, I've found
                            that even a little bit of exercise gives me extra energy and a more positive outlook. Plus,
                            there's
                            something about a simple walk that gives your brain time to sort through and resolve
                            problems."&nbsp;</p>
