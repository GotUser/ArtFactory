                                          182. "Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind. People grow old only
                                          by deserting their
                                          ideals and by outgrowing the consciousness of youth. Years wrinkle the skin,
                                          but to give up
                                          enthusiasm wrinkles the soul... You are as old as your doubt, your fear, your
                                          despair. The way
                                          to keep young is to keep your faith young. Keep your self-confidence young.
                                          Keep your hope
                                          young." - Dr. L.F. Phelan

                                          strategies for
                                          maintaining a state of perfect health (consult an expert at all times and take
                                          a formal course on
                                          the subject to gain powerful insights into this most useful area of healing).

                                    <p>184. Be certain to organize your time around the true priorities of your life. As
                                          Stephen Covey
                                          has noted: "it is easy to say no when there is a deeper yes burning within."
                                    </p>

                                    <p>185. Slow down your pace of life. In this complex age, we are running our lives
                                          at a frantic pace.
                                          Focus on what is truly important and start undertaking activities that will
                                          slow you down and
                                          rekindle the natural, calm within us. Sit in the grass and watch the blue sky
                                          for half an hour - at
                                          first, it is not as easy as one would think and the urge is to get up after
                                          only a few minutes of
                                          such useful relaxation. Once you are used to a healthier pace of living, with
                                          regular periods
                                          dedicated to the simple pleasures of life, every other activity will become
                                          more efficient and
                                          enjoyable.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>186. Try eating only fruit and milk for a full day. Fasting is a powerful success
                                          strategy of the
                                          East that millions use regularly to maintain peak health and mental clarity.
                                          By trying this simple
                                          practice every few weeks you will notice a surge in your energy level and a
                                          lightness in your
                                          walk. Big meals require a significant amount of energy that could be better
                                          directed toward more
                                          productive pursuits.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>187. Value your spouse\'s laugh and keep your partner\'s picture close by your
                                          work desk for
                                          inspiration and pleasant thoughts throughout the day.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>188. If you are married, have your partner\'s initials and your own engraved on
                                          the inside of your
                                          wedding bands along with the date of your marriage. This is useful not only in
                                          case the rings are
                                          lost but to provide you both with personalized keepsakes that may be passed
                                          down to
                                          successive generations.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>189. The mind is like a garden - as you sow, so shall you reap. When you
                                          cultivate it and
                                          nurture it, it will blossom beyond your wildest expectation. But if you let
                                          the weeds take over,

                                          you will never reach your potential. What you put in is what you get out. So
                                          avoid violent
                                          movies, trashy novels and all other negative influences. Peak performers are
                                          meticulous about
                                          the thoughts they allow into the gardens of their minds. You truly cannot
                                          afford the luxury of a
                                          single negative thought.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>190. Do a hundred sit ups a day and do not break this habit. Strong abdominal
                                          muscles are very helpful to ensuring
                                          that you enjoy peak health and injury free days. They also maintain your
                                          appearance and confidence level.
                                    </p>
