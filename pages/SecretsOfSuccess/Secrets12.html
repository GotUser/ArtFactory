                                    <p>111. Read "The Art of the Leader" by William A. Cohen. It is both inspirational
                                          and practical.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>112. Develop that elusive quality known as charisma. The following are ten
                                          qualities of a
                                          charismatic leader:
                                          <br>• Be committed to what you are doing</br>
                                          <br>• Look like a winner and act like one</br>
                                          <br>• Have big dreams, a vision and reach for the sky</br>
                                          <br>• Steadily advance in the direction of your goals</br>
                                          <br>• Prepare and work hard at every task you do</br>
                                          <br>• Build a mystique around yourself</br>
                                          <br>• Be interested in others and show kindness</br>
                                          <br>• Have a strong sense of humour</br>
                                          <br>• Be known for the strength of your character</br>
                                          <br>• Have grace under pressure. </br>
                                          <br>(John F. Kennedy said that "the elusive half-step between middle
                                          management and true leadership is grace under pressure.")</br>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>113. In work, love and life, play hard and play fair.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>114. Do not talk when you are listening. Interrupting is one of the most common
                                          discourtesies.
                                          Listen aggressively with the full scope of your attention. You will be amazed
                                          at what you learn
                                          and how your counsel will soon be sought by many.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>115. "Anybody can become angry - that is easy; but to be angry with the right
                                          person, and to the
                                          right degree, and at the right time, and for the right purpose, and in the
                                          right way - that is not
                                          within everybody\'s power and is not easy." – Aristotle
                                    </p>

                                    <p>116. Knowledge is power. People who have achieved great success are not
                                          necessarily more
                                          skillful or intelligent than others. What separates them is their burning
                                          desire and thirst for
                                          knowledge. The more one knows, the more one achieves. Great leaders have
                                          techniques to
                                          allow them to arrive at the top of the mountain. Read the biographies of the
                                          world\'s leaders and
                                          learn from their habits, inspirations and philosophies. Cultivate the
                                          important practice of active
                                          role modelling.
                                    </p>

                                          117. All the answers to any questions are in print. How to improve as a public
                                          speaker, how to
                                          improve your relations with others, how to become fitter or develop a better
                                          memory – all
                                          aspects of personal development are dealt with in books. Therefore, in order
                                          to achieve your
                                          maximum potential, you must read daily. But, in this age of information, you
                                          must be ruthless in
                                          what you consume. Focus on your goals and read only those materials that will
                                          be an asset to
                                          you. Do not attempt to read everything for you are busy and have other tasks
                                          at hand. Choose
                                          what is important and filter out what is of no value. Begin with a solid
                                          newspaper every morning
                                          for an excellent summary of the key events of the day. Also ensure that your
                                          readings are
                                          broadly based. For example, perhaps you may wish to read history, business,
                                          Eastern
                                          philosophy, health books etc. Then go to the library and develop the habit of
                                          making regular
                                          visits. Read the classics from Hemingway to Bram Stoker. Read history, with
                                          all its lessons on

                                          life and read biology for a new perspective. Look under the heading of
                                          "success" at the library
                                          and you will be amazed at the literature you will find: inspirational stories
                                          of people who
                                          developed greatness in the face of adversity, strategies for improving
                                          yourself physically,
                                          mentally and spiritually and texts to tap the unlimited power for success that
                                          certainly exists
                                          within us. Drink deeply from such books. Surround yourself with them and read
                                          them constantly
                                          whether on the bus each day or before you go to bed. Let them inspire and
                                          motivate you.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>118. Get into the habit of breakfast meetings. An early meal to touch base with a
                                          friend or
                                          business associate is a most pleasant way to start the day and allows you to
                                          maintain your
                                          contacts in the face of a busy schedule.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>119. If you live in a flat, always ensure that it is very bright and has a
                                          swimming pool. A pool is
                                          especially important because it will allow you to exercise no matter how busy
                                          your schedule.
                                          There is nothing like a refreshing swim after a long, productive day. You will
                                          feel excellent and
                                          sleep like a baby.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>120. "Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly
                                          because we
                                          have virtue or excellence, but rather we have those because we have acted
                                          rightly. We are what
                                          we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit." – Aristotle
                                    </p>
