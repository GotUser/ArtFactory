                                    <p>121. "Today is yesterday\'s pupil." - Benjamin Franklin
                                    </p>

                                    <p>122. If you have a choice of taking two paths, always take the more daring of the
                                          two.
                                          Calculated risk taking often produces extraordinary results.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>123. Every day, get away from the noise, the crowds and the rush and spend a few
                                          hours alone
                                          in peaceful introspection, deep reading or simple relaxation.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>124. That which any person who has walked this Earth has achieved you can achieve
                                          with the
                                          right mental attitude, perseverance and industry. Limiting thoughts and weak
                                          mental images
                                          must be banished. One\'s focus must be on the attainment of goals that are
                                          truly important.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>125. Get into the habit of memorizing beautiful poetry. Not only will it be a
                                          great source of
                                          entertainment but it will quickly lift your intellectual functions to a higher
                                          level by improving your
                                          memory, concentration and mental agility.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>126. Keep your words soft and arguments hard.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>127. Break the worry habit by putting things in perspective and laughing over
                                          small setbacks.
                                          Repeat to yourself that "this will soon pass". Then take a sheet of paper,
                                          write out the worry on
                                          your mind. Allot a certain period of time to think on it, isolate the precise
                                          problem and formulate
                                          a powerful line of attack. By this practical technique, your negative, energy
                                          sapping habit will
                                          soon be a faint memory of the past.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>128. Be known as that person who goes the extra mile. The person who works longer
                                          than
                                          others. The one who takes on the extra assignments and follows them through
                                          with great
                                          success. Be the person who always has concerns about others and who makes
                                          family members
                                          feel truly special. Be a standout, the one with a balance in both personal and
                                          professional
                                          excellence. Be a star that shines brightly for all others to admire
                                    </p>

                                    <p>129. Become a committed and sincere networker. Cultivate new friendships. You
                                          will truly be
                                          surprised where people end up over the years and how small, kind gestures will
                                          help you later
                                          on in life. Treat everyone who crosses your path as if they are the most
                                          important person in your
                                          world. You will certainly meet with great success.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>130. When you look for something you will find it. If you constantly expect
                                          exceptional success,
                                          you will surely have it. Peak performers attract success. You must keep the
                                          goals you desire to
                                          achieve at the forefront of your mind throughout the day. Repeat your
                                          ambitions at least five
                                          times a day and visualize yourself achieving them. If your goal is to be rich,
                                          picture the house
                                          you will be living in, the car you will be driving, what it will feel like to
                                          be rich and the pleasure of
                                          attaining your goals in life. Repeat your ambition over and over until you
                                          have complete
                                          certainty that you will attain your desires and eventually you will.
