                                    <p>172. Browse second-hand bookstores every few months searching for lost treasures
                                          of
                                          character-building books. You will find gems on public speaking, improving

                                          texts are the very best and come from an age where every young person was
                                          under an
                                          obligation to develop discipline and good life habits regularly.

                                    <p>173. Read The Magic of Believing by Claude M. Bristol. It will allow you to
                                          release the powerful
                                          forces which most certainly exist in your mind but may presently be untapped.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>174. Be known as someone with a cool head, warm heart and great character. Your
                                          presence
                                          on this earth will long be remembered.

                                    <p>175. It has been said that doing something for others is the highest form of
                                          religion. Every week,
                                          out of the 168 hours available, spend a few in service to others. Many say
                                          that such selfless
                                          service soon becomes a key focus within their lives. Give your time at a
                                          seniors home or to
                                          needy children. Teach someone how to read or offer to give a public lecture on
                                          the subject of
                                          your expertise. Simply take action and do something to leave a legacy.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>176. Fill your home with bright, fresh flowers. This is one of the best
                                          investments you can make.
                                          Let the sounds of great music, loud laughter and good fun fill the oasis of
                                          your home.
                                    </p>

                                          177. Get to know and enjoy your neighbors. They make life more pleasant and
                                          can provide
                                          helpful resources when you least expect it.

                                    <p>178. Recognize the power of mantras and the repetition of positive, powerful
                                          words. Indian
                                          yogis have employed this technique for over 4000 years to live tranquil,
                                          productive and focused
                                          lives. Create your own personal mantra which you can repeat daily to enhance
                                          your character
                                          and strengthen your spirit.

                                          picture that you will be on the
                                          earth for only another day. Who would you call, what would you say and what
                                          would you do? These questions will give you some important insights into what
                                          outstanding
                                          actions you must endeavor to complete.
