                                          41. When you stand and meet someone, stand firm and steadfast. A telling sign
                                          of an
                                          unfocused, weak mind is constant fidgeting, shifting of the eyes and shallow
                                          breathing.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>42. Act tough and you will be tough. Have courage and inspire others with your
                                          actions. But
                                          always be considerate.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>43. Ask not what this world can do for you but, rather, what you can do for this
                                          world. Make
                                          service an important goal in your life. It is a most fulfilling investment of
                                          time. Remember, in thetwilight
                                          of your life, when all is said and done, the quality of your life boils down
                                          to the quality ofyour
                                          contribution to others. Leave a rich legacy for those around you to savour.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>44. Once a week, arise at dawn. It is a magical time of day. Be still, go for a
                                          walk or simply listen
                                          to an old Ella Fitzgerald recording. Take a long, hot shower and do 100
                                          pushups. Read one of
                                          the classics. You will feel alive and invigorated.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>45. Remain slightly aloof. Do not let everyone know everything about you.
                                          Cultivate a mystique.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>46. Master the art of public speaking. There are few natural speakers. One great
                                          trial lawyerstammerred
                                          dreadfully but through courage and strength of conviction, he developed into
                                          abrilliant orator. Role model
                                          anyone you think is a highly effective, influential communicator.
                                          Visualize a picture of this person. Stand like him, smile like him, and talk
                                          like him. The results
                                          will startle you.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>47. Seek out motivational speakers committed to character training and lifelong
                                          success. Make it a point to
                                          attend inspirational lectures each month to consistently renew the importance
                                          of personal growth in your
                                          mind. In a two hour seminar, you can learn powerful techniques and strategies
                                          that others have spent many
                                          years learning and refining. Never feel that you have no time for gathering
                                          new ideas, you are investing in
                                          yourself.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>48. Read the wonderful book "Discovering Happiness" by Dennis Wholey. It will
                                          certainly open
                                          up new horizons for you in your quest for an optimal state of health and
                                          happiness.

                                    <p>49. To enhance your concentration, read a passage in a book you have never
                                          explored. Then
                                          try to recite it verbatim. Practice this for only 5 minutes a day and enjoy
                                          the results which follow
                                          after a few months of effort.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>50. Try entering a 5 km running race and then a 10 km event. The adrenaline that
                                          flows from theexperience of
                                          racing with several hundred other fitness-minded people is exhilarating.
                                          Byconstantly pushing the envelope
                                          of your capacity, your potential will quickly unfold.Remember, the body will
                                          give you only what you ask of
                                          it.
