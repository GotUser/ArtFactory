                                    <p>191. Be the most honest person that you know. Be trustworthy - worthy of the
                                          trust of others.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>192. Curb your worldly desires and you will strengthen your will. He who is
                                          deeply bound to material things runs into
                                          difficulty and unhappiness when they are taken away. Happy people enjoy
                                          worldly objects but do not become bound or
                                          wedded to them. Live a simple, uncluttered and productive existence. To
                                          simplify your life today, consider selling
                                          your television, stopping the junk mail, spending less, learning yoga, selling
                                          your car, practising meditation
                                          every morning and unplugging your ringing phone once in a while.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>193. If you have not laughed today, you have not lived today. Laugh hard and
                                          loud. As William James said: "we don\'t
                                          laugh because we are happy, we are happy because we laugh."
                                    </p>

                                    <p>194. Read The Charisma Factor - How to Develop Your Natural Leadership Ability by
                                          Robert J. Richardson and S.
                                          Katharine Thayer. It is a superb book for any aspiring leader, or a current
                                          one, who seeks to advance to the next
                                          level.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>195. Travel often. The perspective offered by visiting new lands is important and
                                          allows one to appreciate the
                                          existence that we generally take for granted.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>196. Each month set a physical fitness goal for yourself. Start to swim in July
                                          or learn to ski in January. The key
                                          is to arrive at a goal for the month, write it down, consider how to execute
                                          it and then, as the NIKE ad says:
                                          "Just Do It!".
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          197. Things are always created twice. There is always the mental creation
                                          which precedes the physical creation.
                                          Just as plans for a house must first be set down on paper before the house is
                                          started, so too should your day be
                                          planned within your mind early in the morning before the day begins. Visualize
                                          the wonders you desire this life to
                                          bring and they will materialize as your subconscious mind starts to focus on
                                          the attainment of goals. This is a
                                          true law of Nature.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          198. Walk to work and notice the wonderful beauty in Nature.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>199. Sleep less, spend less, do more, live longer and be greater.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          200. Read this book over and over and share it with others!
                                    </p>
