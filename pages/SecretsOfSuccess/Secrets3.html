                                    <p>21. No one can insult or hurt you without your permission. One of the golden keys
                                          to happiness
                                          and great success is the way you interpret events which unfold before you.
                                          Highly successful
                                          people are master interpreters. People who have attained greatness have an
                                          ability which they
                                          have developed to interpret negative or disempowering events as positive
                                          challenges which will
                                          assist them in growing and moving even farther up the ladder of success. There
                                          are no negative
                                          experiences only experiences which aid in your development and toughen your
                                          character so
                                          that you may soar to new heights. There are no failures, only lessons.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>22. Take a speed reading course. Reading is a powerful way to gain many years of
                                          experience
                                          from a few hours of study. For example, most biographies reflect the
                                          strategies and
                                          philosophies of great leaders or courageous individuals. Read them and model
                                          them. Speed
                                          reading will allow you to digest large quantities of material in relatively
                                          small periods of time.
                                    </p>


                                    <p>
                                          23. Remember people\'s names and treat everyone well. This habit, along with
                                          enthusiasm, is
                                          one of the great success secrets. Everyone in this world wears an imaginary
                                          button that
                                          screams out "I WANT TO FEEL IMPORTANT AND APPRECIATED!".
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          24. Be soft as a flower when it comes to kindness but tough as thunder when it
                                          comes to
                                          principle. Be courteous and polite at all times but never be pushed around.
                                          Ensure that you are
                                          always treated with respect.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>25. Never discuss your health, wealth and other personal matters with anyone
                                          outside of your
                                          immediate family. Be very disciplined in this regard.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          26. Be truthful, patient, persevering, modest and generous.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          27. Soak in a warm bath at the end of a long, productive day. Reward yourself
                                          for even the
                                          smallest of achievement. Take time out for renewal of your mind, body and
                                          spirit. Soon all your
                                          more important goals will be met and you will move to the next level of peak
                                          performance.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>28. Learn the power of breathing and its relationship with your energy source.
                                          The mind is
                                          intimately connected with your breathing. For example, when the mind is
                                          agitated, your
                                          breathing becomes quick and shallow. When you are relaxed and focused, your
                                          breathing is
                                          deep and calm. By practising deep, abdominal breathing, you will develop a
                                          calm, serene
                                          demeanour that will remain cool in the hottest of circumstances. Remember the
                                          rule of the
                                          Eastern mountain men: "to breathe properly is to live properly."
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          29. Recognize and cultivate the power of autosuggestion. It works and is an
                                          essential tool in
                                          maintaining peak performance. We are all performers in one way or another and
                                          it is particularly
                                          valuable to use such techniques of athletes and public figures for our own
                                          enhancement. If you
                                          want to become more enthusiastic, repeat "I am more enthusiastic today and am
                                          improving this
                                          trait daily". Repeat it over and over. Purchase a legal notepad and write out
                                          this mantra 500
                                          times. Do it for three weeks with regular practice and feel that this quality
                                          is developing. Very
                                          soon it will come. This is a strategy that Indian sages have employed for
                                          thousands of years to
                                          aid their spiritual and mental development. Do not be discouraged if the
                                          results are not
                                          immediate, they will certainly develop. The spoken word is a powerful
                                          influencer of the mind.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          30. Maintain a diary to measure your progress and to express your thoughts.
                                          Writing out not
                                          only your successes but your troubles is one of the world\'s most effective
                                          methods of erasing
                                          the worry habit, staying in optimum state and developing precision of thought.
                                    </p>
