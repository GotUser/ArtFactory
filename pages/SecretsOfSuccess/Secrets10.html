                                          a quality is
                                          something each one of us has the potential to develop but few do. President
                                          Kennedy was a
                                          sickly youth but rose above his physical problems to be the most charismatic
                                          and exciting
                                          political figure in the history of the United States. Start off small. Take a
                                          Dale Carnegie course
                                          on public speaking. Go to the library where you will find books on the fine
                                          art of conversation
                                          and personal grooming. Learn three clean and witty jokes and get in the habit
                                          of socializing. You
                                          will have fun and build a lasting network of friends and associates.

                                    <p>92. On the subject of conversation, a Chinese proverb states as follows: "a
                                          single conversation
                                          across the table with a wise man is worth a month\'s study of books." Seek out
                                          the wise and
                                          learn from them. They are just waiting for that small spark of interest to
                                          tell you all that you need
                                          to know.
                                    </p>

                                          93. Lao-Tzu prized three essential qualities for a person of greatness: "the
                                          first is gentleness;
                                          the second is frugality; the third is humility, which keeps me from putting
                                          myself before others.
                                          Be gentle and you can be bold; be frugal and you can be liberal; avoid putting
                                          yourself before
                                          others and you can become a leader among men."
                                    </p>

                                    <p>94. "When you cannot make up your mind which of two evenly balanced courses of
                                          action you
                                          should take - choose the bolder," said W. J. Slim. There is no substitute for
                                          courage and though
                                          the chance of stubbing your toe increases the more you walk, it is always
                                          better than going
                                          nowhere by standing still. Take chances, take smart risks and you will meet
                                          with success
                                          beyond your dreams.

                                    <p>95. Become your spouse\'s number one supporter, the one who is always there
                                          supporting and
                                          fueling hopes and dreams. Develop together and march confidently through the
                                          world as an
                                          army of two.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>96. Think of three people who can provide you with inspiration, motivation and
                                          support for your
                                          goals and aspirations. Plan to meet with each one of them over the next few
                                          weeks. Listen
                                          enthusiastically to them and brainstorm with them. Map out a strategy and take
                                          their wise
                                          counsel.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>97. Make every one of your days a true masterpiece. Remember the old saying:
                                          "it\'s not who
                                          you think you are that holds you back but what you think you\'re not."
                                    </p>

                                    <p>98. Just as valuable energy is wasted by spending time on activities that are of
                                          no value, energy
                                          can be wasted on loose thinking. Imagine that your mind has an energy measure
                                          of 1000 watts
                                          at its disposal. Each time your mind wanders off the project at hand, to a
                                          nagging worry, to all
                                          the things to do by the end of the day, 100 watts is lost. Quite soon the
                                          entire energy supply is
                                          gone. This is the nature of the mind. Fail to discipline it and your energy
                                          levels will be depleted
                                          and your accomplishments will be minimal. Control it and you will see great
                                          things happening.
                                          You will feel more powerful and achieve difficult tasks with ease. The 19th
                                          century philosopher

                                          Henri Frederic Amiel summed it up nicely: "for purposes of action, nothing is
                                          more useful than
                                          narrowness of thought combined with energy of will."
                                    </p>

                                    <p>99. It has been rightly said that "you sow an action, you reap a habit. You sow a
                                          habit, you reap
                                          a character. You sow a character, you reap a destiny." The essence of a person
                                          is his character
                                          - make yours unique, unblemished and strong. Do not say you will do anything
                                          unless you will
                                          indeed do it. Speak the truth and measure your words wisely. Be humble,
                                          straightforward and
                                          peaceful.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>100. Remember the overriding law of nature: positive overcomes the negative.
