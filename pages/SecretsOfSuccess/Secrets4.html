                                    <p>31. Stress is simply a response which you create in the interpretation of an
                                          event. Two people
                                          might find that a given event results in quite different responses. For
                                          example, an after dinner
                                          speech might strike fear into the heart of an inexperienced speaker while a
                                          strong orator views it
                                          as a wonderful opportunity to share his thoughts. Understanding that the
                                          perceived negative
                                          effects of an event or task may be mentally manipulated and conditioned
                                          towards the positive,
                                          will allow you to be a peak performer in all instances.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>32. Read "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey. It
                                          contains a wealth
                                          of wisdom and powerful insights into further developing your character and
                                          enhancing your
                                          personal relationships.</p>

                                    <p>33. Become a committed audio-tape user. Most personal-mastery programs and books
                                          are now
                                          offerred in this format. Listen to these inspirational materials on your way
                                          to work, whilst waiting
                                          in the line at a bank or while you wash dishes in the evening. Make your car a
                                          college on wheels
                                          and use the drive time to make knowledge your best friend. All down time can
                                          be very
                                          effectively used in this productive fashion. Use such opportunities to learn
                                          and continually
                                          expand your mind and its vast potential.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>34. Try fasting one day every two weeks. During these fast days, drink fruit
                                          juice and eat fresh
                                          fruits only. You will feel more energetic, cleansed and alert. Fasting also
                                          has a salutary effect on
                                          your willpower as you are subverting the otherwise pressing impulses in your
                                          mind calling on
                                          you to eat more.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>35. Keep a radio-cassette player at your office and listen to soft, soothing
                                          music throughout the
                                          day. Place pleasant scents and inspirational pictures in your workplace. By
                                          the magic of
                                          association, your work will become something you enjoy even more and arouse a
                                          very pleasant
                                          feeling within you. Budget your time on trips such that you can spend half an
                                          hour in the airport
                                          bookstore. They always contain the latest and best self-mastery books and
                                          tapes given that
                                          those who travel by air are of a group that finds value in these materials.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>36. Read "As a Man Thinketh" by James Allen. And don\'t just read this little
                                          book once, read it
                                          over and over again. It contains an abundance of timeless wisdom on living a
                                          fuller and happier
                                          life.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>37. Remember that forgiveness is a virtue that few develop, but one that is most
                                          important to
                                          maintaining peace of mind. Mark Twain wrote that forgiveness is the fragrance
                                          the violet sheds
                                          on the heel that has crushed it. Practice forgiveness especially in those
                                          situations where it is
                                          seemingly difficult. By using your emotional forgiveness muscles more
                                          regularly, petty wrongs,
                                          remarks and slights will not touch you and nothing will penetrate your
                                          concentrated, serene
                                          mindset.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>38. Empty your cup. A full cup cannot accept anything more. Similarly, a person
                                          who believes
                                          that he cannot learn anything else will stagnate quickly and not move to
                                          higher levels. A true
                                          sign of a secure, mature individual is someone who sees every opportunity as a
                                          chance to
                                          learn. Even the teachers have teachers.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>39. The Two Minute Mind is an excellent exercise for developing concentration.
                                          Simply stare at
                                          the second hand on your wristwatch for two minutes and think about nothing
                                          else for that time.
                                          At first your mind will wander but after 21 days of practice, your attention
                                          will not waver during
                                          the routine. One of the greatest qualities a person can develop to ensure his
                                          success is the
                                          ability to focus for extended periods of time. Learn to build up your
                                          concentration muscles and
                                          no task will be too difficult for you.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>40. Drink a cup of warm water before a speech. Ronald Reagan employed this
                                          strategy to
                                          ensure that he maintained his honey-smooth voice. Mastery of the art of public
                                          speaking is a
                                          noble goal. So dedicate yourself to it. You will be judged by the calibre of
                                          your communication
                                          skills.
                                    </p>
