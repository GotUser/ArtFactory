                                    <p>81. Develop the wonderful habit of a daily swim. It will promote excellent
                                          health, keep you
                                          relaxed and concentrated, lean and trim. Swimming is not stressful on the
                                          body, provides a
                                          great workout for the lungs and requires little time to do effectively.
                                          Remember that in a fit body
                                          resides a fit mind.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>82. People who are doing good today are ensuring their happiness for tomorrow.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>83. The key to successful time management is doing what you planned to do when
                                          you planned
                                          to do it. Keep your mind fully on the task at hand. Only then will you achieve
                                          all your goals and
                                          have time for the things that matter most. Although it is imperative to be
                                          flexible (a bow too
                                          tightly strung will soon break), following your planned schedule requires no
                                          more than simple
                                          discipline.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>84. An excellent visualization technique: if you are worrying about something,
                                          picture the words
                                          of your worry on a piece of paper. Now ignite a match to the paper and watch
                                          the worry
                                          dissipate into flames. Bruce Lee, the great martial arts master employed this
                                          mental control
                                          device regularly.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>85. Compartmentalize your worry. Set aside a certain amount of time to ponder
                                          over a problem
                                          and map out an effective plan of attack and your options. Once this is done,
                                          have the mental
                                          fortitude not to come back to the problem and go over it again and again. The
                                          human mind is a
                                          strange creature things we want to forget keep coming back and those things we
                                          want to
                                          remember are not there when we want them. But the mind is similar to a muscle
                                          and the more
                                          you flex it the stronger it will become. Make it your servant. Feed it only
                                          the best nutrition and
                                          information. It will serve you well and perform magic if you believe in it.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>86. Peak performers are physically relaxed and mentally engaged.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>87. To be at your performance peak mentally, your body must be loose physically
                                          and relaxed.
                                          It is now beyond dispute that there is a mind-body connection and when the
                                          body is supple, free
                                          from tension, the mind is clear, calm and focused as well. This is why yoga is
                                          such a beneficial
                                          activity. It keeps the body relaxed so that the mind can follow. Basic
                                          stretching for 15 minutes a
                                          day is also an excellent way to release tension that builds up as a result of
                                          our life in this highly
                                          complex and fast moving, but wonderful world. Try having a massage or power
                                          lounging in a
                                          Jacuzzi. Relax the body and you relax the mind.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>88. Prepare a detailed financial plan for the next few years and follow it. Seek
                                          out financial
                                          advice if you need it. A powerful strategy for financial mastery is also a
                                          simple one: save 10% of
                                          all you make for long-term growth (take this off the pay cheque before you
                                          have a chance to
                                          spend it). If you can invest $200 a month for the next 30 years at an annual
                                          return rate of 15%,
                                          you will end up with $1.4 million dollars. Being wise with your money is one
                                          of the very best
                                          investments to make. Financial security leads to personal freedom.

                                    <p>89. Readers are leaders. U.S. President Bill Clinton read more than 300 books
                                          during his short
                                          time at Oxford University. Some top performers read a book a day. Seek out
                                          knowledge and
                                          information. We have truly entered the age of massive information and those
                                          who are proactive
                                          can use this to their advantage. The more you know, the less you fear.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>90. Get into the excellent habit of reading something positive and inspirational
                                          before you go to bed and as soon as
                                          you awake in the morning. You will soon note the benefits as these
                                          thoughts will be supporting you throughout the day.
                                    </p>
