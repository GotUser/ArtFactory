                                    <p>161. Each day, do two things that you do not like doing. This may be the
                                          preparation of a report
                                          you have been putting off or shining your shoes. It does not matter how small
                                          the task, just do it!
                                          Soon these chores will not seem so bad, your personal power will increase and
                                          your productivity
                                          will soar. Try it because this is an age-old technique for building strength
                                          of character.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>162. True happiness comes from only one thing: achievement of goals, whether they
                                          are
                                          personal, professional or otherwise. You are happiest when you feel you are
                                          growing. When you
                                          feel that you are contributing and advancing in the direction of your dreams,
                                          you will notice that
                                          you have boundless energy and vitality. Time spent on activities which offer
                                          little reward aside
                                          from a fleeting feeling of relaxation (television watching is the best
                                          example), is time lost forever.
                                          Relaxation is essential but chose the most effective means of renewal and
                                          spend your time in
                                          productive pursuits that will slowly move you along the path of
                                          accomplishment. Happiness
                                          comes from doing - not sleeping.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>163. Napoleon III of France had a special ability to remember the names of all
                                          those he met. His
                                          secret was to say "so sorry, I missed your name" after being introduced to a
                                          new person. This
                                          would cause the name to be repeated and reinforced within his memory. If the
                                          name was
                                          difficult, he would ask for the proper spelling.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>164. The sages of China have held a basic life philosophy for thousands of years:
                                          develop an
                                          indomitable spirit along with courtesy and integrity. The repetition of these
                                          three traits will make
                                          you an exceptionally powerful individual respected by all. Exert your effort
                                          and personal
                                          influence to attain these qualities.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>165. A valuable technique for defeating negative and self-limiting thoughts that
                                          can hamper you
                                          from attaining peak performance is the mental interrupt device. When a
                                          negative thought enters
                                          your consciousness, first you must become aware of it and have a strong desire
                                          to remove it for
                                          good. To do this, interrupt the negative train of thought by doing something
                                          to break and banish
                                          the self-limiting pattern. When the bad thought enters, you may pinch yourself
                                          and say, "I am
                                          strong and weak thoughts are gone", or you may shout out loud or do anything
                                          that will divert
                                          your attention and remove the negative focus. By practising this technique,
                                          you will see a
                                          marked decrease in the negative thoughts that most people have, paving the way
                                          to the mindset
                                          of a true winner.

                                    <p>166. Taking time from your busy work and family schedule to focus on personal
                                          growth activities
                                          is essential and is never to be considered a waste. Taking one hour from your
                                          hectic morning to
                                          watch kids playing in a nearby park or to take a brisk walk might seem like a
                                          poor use of time to
                                          some. But by making more time for life\'s simple pleasures and bringing more
                                          balance into your
                                          day, you will make the remaining hours far more productive and effective. You
                                          cannot do good
                                          unless you feel good. When you are serene, relaxed and enthusiastic you are
                                          also more
                                          productive, creative and dynamic. This is something that has been proved time
                                          and time again
                                          and yet we consistently get caught up in the apparent immediacy of our routine
                                          and fail to see
                                          the forest for the trees.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>167. Read more, learn more, laugh more and love more.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>168. Pick five relationships that you desire to improve over the next six months.
                                          Write out the
                                          names of these people and under each name detail why you want to improve the
                                          relationship,
                                          how you plan to do so and in what time frame. This is simply another facet of
                                          goal setting - the
                                          practice which will always yield excellent results in any of life\'s fields.
                                          Be committed to being a
                                          better parent, friend and citizen. Be creative in the steps you take to show
                                          your appreciation and
                                          respect for your loved ones. Sending notes is fine but consider unique and
                                          thoughtful measures
                                          ranging from a romantic picnic in the country with your partner to an early
                                          morning fishing trip
                                          with an old friend.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          169. Remember the power of prayer.

                                    <p>170. An excellent investment in your personal growth is the six tape series of
                                          Reverend Norman Vincent Peale entitled
                                          "The Power of Positive Thinking". Get it and listen to it over and over. It is
                                          packed full of strategies and
                                          techniques that, without fail, will ensure that you live a long, happy,
                                          productive and prosperous life.
