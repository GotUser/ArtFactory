                                    <p>71. Be kind, considerate and courteous. But also be shrewd and know when to be
                                          tough and
                                          courageous. This is the mark of a well-defined character and you will surely
                                          command respect.
                                          It is most useful to read books on friendliness and enhancing relationships by
                                          being a good
                                          listener, showing others sincere appreciation and refining other interpersonal
                                          skills. But, to truly
                                          succeed, one must also recognize that worldly wisdom and shrewdness are
                                          essential skills to
                                          foster. Become an expert in human psychology and be able to read the essence
                                          of people.
                                          Never be taken advantage of and be aware of the politics around you. Stay
                                          above petty
                                          gossiping and office politics but appreciate that they indeed exist and know
                                          what goes on
                                          behind your back. Every great leader does.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>72. Create your image as a highly competent, strong, disciplined, calm and decent
                                          individual.
                                          Find that crucial balance between working on the image that you project to the
                                          rest of the world
                                          and your inner character. Create a sense of mystery about yourself as the
                                          truly wise never show
                                          their hand. Do not tell everyone everything about yourself, your strategies
                                          and your aspirations.
                                          The successful citizens of this world think thrice before they speak because a
                                          word uttered can
                                          never be retrieved. Make things look easy and people will say you are
                                          naturally gifted. Speak
                                          only good things and people will flock to you. Never speak ill of others and
                                          all will know you will
                                          not malign them behind their backs. Build your character and live a highly
                                          principled life.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>73. Familiarity breeds contempt is a very good rule. The stars remain far above
                                          the Earth. You
                                          must keep a distance from all but your closest of relations. Once people see
                                          everything of a
                                          leader he loses his aura and with it the authority and mystique he may have
                                          created. For
                                          example, Ronald Reagan was known to many as an excellent leader. He carefully
                                          cultivated his
                                          image of a folksy, considerate politician who kept the interests of the United
                                          States first and
                                          foremost in his mind. At gatherings of world leaders, he commanded attention
                                          and respect in his
                                          dark suits, surrounded by the trappings of power such as political aides,
                                          security officers and a
                                          convoy of limousines. As soon as he appeared, thoughts of authority and power
                                          came to our
                                          minds. Did you ever see the President with his shirt off swimming at his pool?
                                          How about in his
                                          dressing gown after waking up after one of his long sleeps, hair tousled and
                                          beard grown?
                                          Reagan\'s handlers never allowed such glimpses because they detract from the
                                          perception of
                                          authority. The American nation was not exposed to these sights. In the Clinton
                                          Era things
                                          changed and you saw the President eating Big Macs and wearing baseball caps
                                          with a full
                                          business suit. Whilst these scenes may be endearing to the public, there is
                                          little doubt that
                                          President Clinton was more familiar to us, merely another one of us and,
                                          unlike the stars above,
                                          much closer to the ground.

                                    <p>74. Learn to organize your time. It is incorrect to say that by becoming a
                                          meticulous time
                                          manager and living by a carefully defined schedule you become rigid and
                                          nonspontaneous.
                                          Rather, proper organization allows one to accomplish those goals which are
                                          truly important as
                                          well as enjoy leisure time. Good time management offers more time for fun and
                                          relaxation - not
                                          less. These important periods are scheduled into the week just like other
                                          commitments which
                                          may appear more pressing. Neither are sacrificed. Also, discipline yourself
                                          and stop wasting
                                          time on all those immediate and pressing but unimportant tasks (i.e., the
                                          ringing phones) and
                                          concentrate on the activities that are truly meaningful to your life\'s
                                          mission. Such activities
                                          include time for self-renewal and reflection, time forging relationships built
                                          on trust and mutual
                                          respect, time for physical fitness, time to read and think deeply and time
                                          serving others in your
                                          community.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>75. Keep well-informed about current events, the latest books and popular trends.
                                          Many peak
                                          performers read five or six papers a day. You don\'t have to read every story
                                          of every paper.
                                          Know what to focus on, what to pass by and what to clip out and read at
                                          another time (many
                                          successful people scan scores of magazines and papers, clipping out articles
                                          of interest; these
                                          articles go into a file folder which can be read in your down time). Knowledge
                                          is power. Whether
                                          you are an entrepreneur, a corporate leader or someone leading a family, you
                                          can profoundly
                                          change your life and the lives of those around you with a single idea. Just
                                          ask Gates, Edison
                                          and Bell.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>76. When choosing your life partner, remember that this is the most important
                                          decision of your
                                          lifetime. The marriage relationship offers 90% of all your support, happiness
                                          and fulfillment so
                                          choose it wisely. Consider qualities such as affection, sense of humor,
                                          intelligence, integrity,
                                          maturity, temperament, compatibility and that indescribable characteristic of
                                          chemistry. If these
                                          are present, your relationship stands an excellent chance of great success.
                                          Move slowly and let
                                          no one press you into an uncomfortable decision.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>77. Never discuss your personal development activities with anyone. Your
                                          strategies for
                                          expanding your mind and spirit are your own. Others might not understand the
                                          value of
                                          personal-mastery and, further, will take away your credit when you meet with
                                          success by saying
                                          that you relied on techniques. Keep these self-development activities to
                                          yourself.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>78. Schedule relaxation time into your week and be ruthless in protecting it. You
                                          would not
                                          schedule another activity into the time planned for an important meeting with
                                          the president of
                                          your company or your best client so why would you put off a period to invest
                                          in yourself? We
                                          must have time for ourselves to reflect, unwind and recharge our batteries.
                                          These are the
                                          renewal activities that allow us to maintain peak performance and are
                                          exceptionally valuable
                                          periods.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>79. 83% of our sensory input comes from our eyes. To truly concentrate on
                                          something, shut
                                          your eyes and you will remove much distraction.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>80. Be the master of your will but the servant of your conscience.
