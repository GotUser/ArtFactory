                                    <p>141. Some men see things as they are and say "why?" I dream of things that never
                                          were and
                                          say "why not?" George Bernard Shaw
                                    </p>

                                    <p>142. Use these strategies to improve the quality of your mind-calming meditation:
                                          <br>1. Practice meditation at the same time each day and in the same place so
                                          that your mind
                                          becomes accustomed to entering the desired serene state as soon as you enter
                                          the peaceful
                                          place.</br>
                                          <br>2. The early morning is undoubtedly the most powerful time to meditate.
                                          Indian yogis believe
                                          that the pre-dawn time has almost magical qualities which aid in achieving the
                                          super-peaceful
                                          state so many meditators attempt to attain.</br>
                                          <br>3. Before you start, command your mind to be quiet by using affirmations
                                          such as "I will be
                                          focused and very calm now."</br>
                                          <br>4. If thoughts do enter, do not force them out but simply let them pass
                                          like clouds making way
                                          for the beautiful blue sky. Picture that your mind is like a still lake
                                          without even a ripple.</br>
                                          <br>5. Sit for ten minutes at first and then increase the time every few
                                          sittings. After a month or two,
                                          you will not be interrupted by any pressing thoughts and will surely feel a
                                          sense of peace that
                                          you have never felt before.</br>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          143. Forge and foster great friendships as such relationships are essential
                                          for maintaining a
                                          healthy and successful life. Find a few minutes every day to jot down some
                                          warm wishes to an
                                          old friend or to place a telephone call to someone you have not had a chance
                                          to speak to for a
                                          while. Show compassion and sincere consideration for all your friends and
                                          watch the results
                                          which follow. Develop long lasting friendships by being a good friend. Also,
                                          make it a priority to
                                          seek out new friends no matter how many you may be fortunate enough to have.
                                          This is one of
                                          life\'s greatest joys which many of us miss.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>144. Purchase a cassette or CD of Miles Davis\'s Kind Of Blue. It is a uniquely
                                          soothing
                                          compilation that will refresh and soothe you after a challenging and
                                          productive day. Music such
                                          as this is good for the soul.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>145. Drown your appetite by drinking more water - ten glasses a day is ideal. It
                                          revitalizes the
                                          system and purifies the body. Also, get into the habit of eating soups and
                                          more complex
                                          carbohydrates such as rice, potatoes and pasta which feed your hunger with far
                                          less calories
                                          than other less healthy foods. You truly are what you eat and must ensure that
                                          your diet is
                                          designed to maximize your energy and mental clarity.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>146. Develop the essential habit of punctuality for it is most important for high
                                          success.
                                          Punctuality reflects discipline and a proper regard for others. Without it,
                                          even the most
                                          sophisticated person appears slightly offensive. Do not be early and certainly
                                          never be late.
                                          Budget your time and, should you arrive early, take a walk or simply relax for
                                          a few moments to
                                          ensure that you arrive on time as requested. You will be appreciated and
                                          welcomed always if
                                          you cultivate this important quality that appears so rarely these days.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          147. The telephone is there for your convenience, not for the convenience of
                                          others who are
                                          attempting to contact you. If you are busy with a task, do not answer the
                                          phone or have
                                          someone answer the call so that you may return it at a more suitable time. Do
                                          not let such
                                          interruptions waste your time. Most phone calls are not important and last far
                                          too long anyway.
                                          Over the course of the average American\'s lifetime, she will spend two years
                                          unsuccessfully
                                          returning phone calls. There are so many important and fun things to do in
                                          life. The challenge is
                                          to respect precious time so that we can achieve a fuller, more satisfying
                                          life.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>148. Start your day off well. Before you get out of bed each morning, say a
                                          prayer or repeat your
                                          personal affirmation giving thanks for the day and all the positive things you
                                          will see and
                                          achieve. Make a conscious decision to make this the best day of your life and
                                          meet with
                                          pleasure, success and fun. If you believe it, it will most certainly happen. A
                                          timeless secret for
                                          lifelong success is to live each day as if it were your last.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>149. Confide in your partner. This will strengthen the relationship and allow you
                                          both to grow at
                                          the same pace. It is also a wonderful tonic to share important or otherwise
                                          troubling things with
                                          the person you are closest to.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>150. Push yourself just a little harder and a little farther each day. Winners on
                                          the playing field of
                                          life push the envelope of their potential daily. Do the thing you fear and the
                                          death of fear is
                                          certain. Winners do the things that less developed people don\'t like doing
                                          even though they also
                                          might not enjoy doing them. This is what strength of character and courage is
                                          all about. Tackle
                                          your weaknesses. Do the thing that you have consistently put off. Write that
                                          thank you note or
                                          letter that you have neglected for so long. Exercise your discipline muscles
                                          and they will rise to
                                          the occasion by filling your day with more satisfaction, more effectiveness
                                          and far more energy.
