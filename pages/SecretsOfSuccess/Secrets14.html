                                    <p>131. Develop a sense of wonder about the world. Be an explorer. Find pleasure in
                                          the things
                                          that others take for granted. Stop and actually listen to that wonderful
                                          street musician playing
                                          the trumpet. Read that classic book your father loved so much. Plan to get
                                          away from the city
                                          next week and visit a secluded, powerfully natural place for a few days. Take
                                          a mini-retreat and
                                          care for your mind, body and spirit. It will profoundly improve the quality of
                                          your life.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>132. Send cards on birthdays and little notes from time to time showing that you
                                          care and were
                                          thinking about your relations. We are all busy but if you spend just five
                                          minutes a week to send
                                          a card to a friend or family member, by the year end you will have sent out 52
                                          cards. This is a
                                          small investment for the dividends that are guaranteed to follow.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>133. Remember and use people\'s names when you talk to them. A person\'s name is
                                          a uniquely
                                          sweet sound to them.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>134. Go outdoors and look up into the blue sky for half an hour. Note the
                                          supremely strong
                                          feeling that you get when you are connected to Nature. Get away from your
                                          rigid schedule today
                                          and spend the afternoon in a beautiful setting. Walk in the woods and sit by a
                                          cool stream. Go
                                          fishing or rent a canoe. Getting away from your routine will provide a
                                          refreshing release and
                                          make you feel wonderful when you eventually return.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          135. Once every few weeks, leave your watch at home. In this society we often
                                          become bound
                                          to the clock and soon it governs our every action like a rigid taskmaster. Go
                                          through the day
                                          doing precisely what you wish to do and for however long you wish to do it.
                                          Spend time with that
                                          special person without having to run off to your next appointment. Savour the
                                          moments and
                                          focus on what is truly important rather than those mundane things that somehow
                                          take on a
                                          greater importance than they really deserve. Lose the clock and gain some
                                          quality time
                                    </p>


                                    <p>136. Laugh at work and be known as a positive achiever.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>137. An idea gives rise to a mental image. A mental image will then generate a
                                          mental habit out
                                          of which a mental trait ultimately blossoms. Master your thoughts and you
                                          master your mind;
                                          master your mind and you master your life; master your life and you master
                                          your destiny.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>138. Recognize the tremendous power of opposition thinking. This simple technique
                                          simply
                                          involves the substitution of a positive thought each and every time a negative
                                          or limiting thought
                                          enters your mind and begins to detract from your focus. For example, on a
                                          Sunday evening, you
                                          may think "I wish I did not have to return to work tomorrow after such a
                                          pleasant and relaxing
                                          weekend." Immediately replace this defeating thought pattern before it begins
                                          to take hold by
                                          thinking the opposite. For example you might think "I cannot wait to return to
                                          the office given the
                                          exciting projects on the go and the wonderful sense of accomplishment I
                                          receive after a
                                          productive, challenging week." Then think how fortunate you are to have a job
                                          and one that you
                                          can advance in through your own efforts and productivity. Make a list of all
                                          of the positive
                                          attributes of your position and repeat them over and over. Soon the negative
                                          pattern will be
                                          broken and you will look toward the exciting week ahead with that most
                                          fabulous of qualities:
                                          enthusiasm.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>139. Get deep into the habit of personal introspection. Ben Franklin called this
                                          one of the most
                                          important strategies for personal effectiveness. Spend ten minutes every night
                                          before you go to
                                          bed in self-examination. Think about the good things you did during the day
                                          and the bad actions
                                          you may have taken which you must change in order to excel and grow.
                                          Successful people are
                                          simply more thoughtful than others. Daily reflection will soon allow for the
                                          eradication of your
                                          negative qualities (ranging from procrastination to gossiping to insulting
                                          others) and will sharpen
                                          the mind. After steady practice, a time will eventually arrive when the
                                          mistakes you make are
                                          few indeed and your personal power will move to the highest level.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>140. The most efficient and effective alarm clock ever developed lies within our
                                          own minds. If you do not believe
                                          this, try the following:
                                          <br>1. Sit in an easy chair approximately ten minutes
                                          before you go to bed.</br>
                                          <br>2. Shut your eyes and gently rest your hands on your knees.</br>
                                          <br>3. Breathe deeply for a few minutes (inhale to the count of five, hold to
                                          the count of ten and exhale
                                          fully).</br>
                                          <br>4.Repeat the following command to yourself at least twenty times: "I will
                                          awake at (the desired
                                          time) feeling fresh, alert and enthusiastic." This command must be said with
                                          feeling and
                                          emotion. Then take a few seconds to visualize yourself waking up at the
                                          desired time (the more
                                          detailed the mental picture the better) and imagine how great you will feel.
                                          You will soon wake
                                          up at the desired moment after little or no practice.</br>
