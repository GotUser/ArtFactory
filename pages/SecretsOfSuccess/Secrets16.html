                                    <p>151. All individuals who have attained the highest of levels generally have
                                          cultivated the
                                          essential mental habit of optimism. Without optimism, life loses its lustre
                                          and hardships appear
                                          at every step of the way. This is an essential life habit.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>152. Today, write down the seven best qualities of individuals who you admire and
                                          post this list
                                          by your bed. Then, each morning as you rise, focus on a new quality which you
                                          will strive to
                                          implement during the day. After one week, you will notice small differences in
                                          yourself. In one
                                          month, these traits will become firmly embedded. After two months, all those
                                          important qualities
                                          will be yours.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>153. You have as many reputations as you do acquaintances as each person you know
                                          thinks
                                          differently of you. What should truly concern you is your character. You have
                                          full control of this
                                          and this is what you must develop, refine and cultivate. Once your character
                                          is strong and
                                          vigorous, then all else that is positive will follow.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>154. Consider yourself as an orange. Only what is really inside can come out. If
                                          you fill your
                                          mind with thoughts of serenity, positivity, strength, courage and compassion,
                                          when someone
                                          squeezes you, this is the only juice that can flow.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>155. Our lives have been described as a parenthesis in eternity. We are but a
                                          small blip on the
                                          stage of the Universe. As we can take nothing with us when we leave, then the
                                          real meaning of
                                          our existence must be to give and serve others. Keep this in mind. When you
                                          wake up early in
                                          the morning, repeat the mantra: "I will serve others today, I will care for
                                          others today and I will
                                          be kind today." This kind of living will bring you huge returns if you stay on
                                          the purpose of aiding
                                          others rather than on the outcome of personal gain.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>156. Be known as an innovator at your place of work. Sit down over the next week
                                          and write out
                                          ten suggestions for your supervisor as to how to improve the work being done
                                          and the quality of
                                          the workplace itself. Be known as an idea person willing to discover
                                          challenges and tackle them
                                          with zest and enthusiasm.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>157. Learn to laugh at yourself.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>158. Keep open the windows of your mind.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>159. Try to go through one full day without saying "I". Focus on others. Listen
                                          to others and you will learn
                                          wonderful new things as well as gain friendships.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>160. Spend one hour a day in full silence except in answer to direct questions.
                                          Even then,
                                          answer directly and without extending the conversation unduly. We, so very
                                          often, talk around
                                          subjects and repeat ourselves. This ancient Eastern exercise will not only
                                          build your will-power
                                          but develop clarity and precision of language which is essential for effective
                                          communication
                                    </p>
