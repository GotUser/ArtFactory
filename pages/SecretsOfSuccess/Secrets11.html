                                    <p>101. A contented mind is a continual feast. Greed and material desires must be
                                          curbed to
                                          achieve lasting happiness and serenity. Be happy with what you have. Do you
                                          really need all of
                                          those material possessions? One can develop contentment just as one develops
                                          patience,
                                          courage and concentration - with daily practice and sincere desire.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>102. Make a new friend or acquaintance every day. Keep an updated list of all
                                          contacts close at
                                          hand. Rich relationships are the DNA of a rich, rewarding life.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>103. Remember this ancient Indian proverb: "if you conquer your mind, you conquer
                                          the world."
                                    </p>

                                    <p>104. Place greater importance on staying happy than amassing material
                                          possessions. A zest for
                                          life is developed and carefully nurtured through thoughtful activities and
                                          pursuits.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>105. Contrary to popular opinion, stress is not a bad thing. It allows us to
                                          perform at peak levels and can assist us
                                          through the flood of chemicals it releases within our bodies. What is harmful
                                          is too much stress, or more
                                          particularly, a lack of relief from stress. The times of stress must be
                                          balanced nicely with times of pure relaxation and leisure for us to be healthy
                                          and at our best.
                                          Many of the great leaders of our time were exposed to crushing workloads and
                                          the burdens of
                                          high office. But they prospered by developing strategies to balance the
                                          challenging times with
                                          fun and calming times. President Kennedy would have regular naps in his White
                                          House office.
                                          Winston Churchill had the same practice and slept for one hour every afternoon
                                          to stay alert,
                                          focused and calm. Not only is it essential to be physically relaxed to
                                          maintain optimal health but
                                          one must couple this trait with mental serenity. Too often people think that
                                          vigorous exercise,
                                          good nutrition and pleasant leisure activities will be the panacea for all
                                          ills. These pursuits must
                                          be combined with positive thinking and peace of mind for true happiness and
                                          longevity.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>106. Get into the habit of taking mental vacations throughout the day. Visit
                                          Bermuda for five
                                          minutes in the morning. Visualize a swim in the Mediterranean in the afternoon
                                          and skiing down
                                          the slopes of the Alps just before you head for home at the end of your busy
                                          and productive
                                          day. Try this for two months and schedule these rest periods into your agenda
                                          just as you would
                                          your essential meetings or tasks. The rewards will be significant.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>107. A change is as good as a rest. Whether this change is as major as a change
                                          of
                                          employment or as minor as a leisure pursuit which occupies your entire
                                          attention for an hour
                                          three times a week, these changes in routine, and mindset are entirely
                                          beneficial. In selecting
                                          the activity, try to find something totally engaging which requires deep
                                          concentration so that
                                          your mind is free from the mundane but seemingly important aspects of your
                                          day. Many
                                          executives are becoming involved in the martial arts for just this reason. If
                                          your mind wanders
                                          for even a split second, a harsh lesson is soon learned. Pain is a great
                                          motivator and always will
                                          be.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>108. Study these 10 fundamentals of happiness:

                                          <br>v. Think positively - you cannot afford the luxury of a negative
                                          thought</br>
                                          <br>vi. Avoid needless worry over trifling matters</br>
                                          <br>vii. Devote time to fun</br>
                                          <br>viii. Develop a warm, outgoing personality with a sincere love of
                                          people</br>
                                          <br>ix. Get in the habit of giving more than receiving</br>
                                          <br>x. Learn to live in the present. The past is water
                                          under the bridge of life.</br>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>109. Strive to be humble and live a simple life.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>110. Read "A History of Knowledge" by Charles Van Doren which chronicles the
                                          history of the world\'s ideas. In this
                                          one book is an absolute wealth of knowledge. Get it, read it and enjoy it.
                                    </p>
