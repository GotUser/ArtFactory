                        <p>
                            1. Sleep less. This is one of the best investments you can make to make your life more
                            productive and rewarding. Most people do not need more than 6 hours to maintain an excellent
                            state of health. Try getting up one hour earlier for 21 days and it will develop into a
                            powerful
                            habit. Remember, it is the quality not the quantity of sleep that is important. And just
                            imagine
                            having an extra 30 hours a month to spend on the things that are important to you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            2. Set aside one hour every morning for personal development matters. Meditate, visualize
                            yourday, read inspirational texts to set the tone of your day, listen to motivational tapes
                            or read greatliterature. Take this quiet period to vitalize and energize your spirit for the
                            productive day ahead.Watch the sun rise once a week or be with nature. Starting the day off
                            well is a powerful
                            strategy for self-renewal and personal effectiveness.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            3. Do not allow those things that matter the most in your life be at the mercy of activities
                            thatmatter the least. Every day, take the time to ask yourself the question "is this the
                            best use of mytime and energy?" Time management is life management so guard your time with
                            great care.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            4. Use the rubber band method to condition your mind to focus solely on the most positive
                            elements in your life. Place a rubber band around your wrist. Each time a negative, energy
                            sapping thought enters your mind, snap the rubber band. Through the power of conditioning,
                            your mind will associate pain with negative thinking and you will soon possess a strongly
                            positive mindset.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            5. Always answer the phone with enthusiasm in your voice and show your appreciation for the
                            caller. Good phone manners are essential. To convey authority on the line, stand up. This
                            will
                            instill further confidence in your voice.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            6. Throughout the day we all get inspiration and excellent ideas. Keep a set of cards (the
                            size of
                            business cards; available at most stationary stores) in your wallet along with a pencil to
                            jot down
                            these insights. When you get home, put the ideas in a central place such as a coil notepad
                            and
                            review them from time to time. As noted by Oliver Wendell Holmes: "Man\'s mind, once
                            stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions."
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            7. Set aside every Sunday evening for yourself and be strongly disciplined with this habit.
                            Usethis period to plan your week, visualize your encounters and what you want to achieve, to
                            readnew materials and inspirational books, to listen to soft soothing music and to simply
                            relax. This habit will serve as your anchor to keep you focused, motivated and effective
                            throughout the
                            coming week.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            8. Always remember the key principle that the quality of your life is the quality of your
                            communication. This means the way you communicate with others and, more importantly, the
                            way you communicate with yourself. What you focus on is what you get. If you look for the
                            positive this is what you get. This is a fundamental law of Nature.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            9. Stay on purpose, not on outcome. In other words, do the task because it is what you love
                            todo or because it will help someone or is a valuable exercise. Don\'t do it for the money
                            or the
                            recognition. Those will come naturally. This is the way of the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            10. Laugh for five minutes in the mirror each morning. Steve Martin does. Laughter activates
                            many beneficial chemicals within the body that place us into a very joyous state. Laughter
                            also
                            returns the body to a state of balance. Laughter therapy has been regularly used to heal
                            persons with varied ailments and is a wonderful tonic for life\'s ills. While the average 4
                            year old
                            laughs 500 times a day, the average adult is lucky to laugh 15 times a day. Revitalize the
                            habit
                            of laughter, it will put far more living into your life.
                        </p>
