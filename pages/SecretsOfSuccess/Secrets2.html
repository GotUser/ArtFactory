                        <p>11. Light a candle beside you when you are reading in the evening. It is most relaxing and
                            creates a wonderful, soothing atmosphere. Make your home an oasis from the frenzied world
                            outside. Fill it with great music, great books and great friends.
                        </p>

                        <p>12. To enhance your concentration and powers of focus, count your steps when you walk. This
                            is a particularly strong technique. Take six steps while taking a long inhale, hold your
                            breath for
                            another six steps, and then exhale for six steps. If six steps is too long for the breaths,
                            do
                            whatever you feel comfortable with. You will feel very alert, refreshed, internally quiet
                            and
                            centerred after this exercise. So many people allow their minds to be filled with mental
                            chatter.
                            All peak performers appreciate the power of a quiet, clear mind which will concentrate
                            steadily
                            on all important tasks.
                        </p>

                        <p>13. Learn to meditate effectively. The mind is naturally a very noisy machine which wants to
                            move from one subject to another like an unchained monkey. One must learn to restrain and
                            discipline it if one is to achieve anything of substance and to be peaceful. Meditation for
                            twenty
                            minutes in the morning and twenty minutes in the evening will certainly provide you with
                            exceptional results if regularly practiced for six months. Learned sages of the East have
                            been
                            advancing the many benefits of meditation for over 5000 years.
                        </p>

                        <p>14. Learn to be still. The average person doesn\'t spend even 30 minutes a month in total
                            silence
                            and tranquility. Develop the skill of sitting quietly, enjoying the powerful silence for at
                            least ten
                            minutes a day. Simply think about what is important to you in your life. Reflect on your
                            mission.
                            Silence indeed is golden. As the Zen master once said, it is the space between the bars that
                            holds the cage.
                        </p>

                        <p>15. Enhance your will-power; it is likely one of the best training programs you can invest
                            in. Here
                            are some ideas to strengthen your will and become a stronger person:
                            <br>a. Do not let your mind float like a piece of paper in the wind. Work hard to keep it
                            focused at all
                            times. When doing a task, think of nothing else. When walking to work, count the steps that
                            it
                            takes to get all the way to the office. This is not easy but your mind will soon understand
                            that
                            you hold its reins and not vice versa. Your mind must eventually become as still as a candle
                            flame in a corner where there is no draft.</br>
                            <br>b. Your will is like a muscle. You must first exercise it and then push before it gets
                            stronger. This
                            necessarily involves short term pain but be assurred that the improvements will come and
                            will
                            touch your character in a most positive way. When you are hungry, wait another hour before
                            your meal. When you are labouring over a difficult task and your mind is prompting you to
                            pick
                            up the latest magazine for a break or to get up and go talk to a friend, curb the impulse.
                            Soon
                            you will be able to sit for hours in a precisely concentrated state. Sir Issac Newton, one
                            of the
                            greatest classical physicists the world has produced, once said:
                            "if I have done the public any service, it is due to patient thought." Newton had a
                            remarkable
                            ability to sit quietly and think without interruption for very long periods of time. If he
                            can develop
                            this so can you.</br>
                            <br>c. You can also build your will-power by restraint in your conduct with others. Speak
                            less (use
                            the 60/40 Rule = listen 60% of the time and speak a mere 40%, if that). This will not only
                            make
                            you more popular but you will learn much wisdom as everyone we meet, every day has
                            something to teach us. Also restrain the urge to gossip or to condemn someone who you feel
                            has made a mistake. Stop complaining and develop a cheerful, vital and strong personality.
                            You
                            will greatly influence others.</br>
                            <br>d. When a negative thought comes to your mind, immediately replace it with one that is
                            positive.
                            Positive always dominates over the negative and your mind has to be conditioned to think
                            only
                            the best thoughts. Negative thinking is a conditioned process whereby the negative patterns
                            are
                            established over and over. Rid yourself of any limitations and become a powerful positive
                            thinker.</br>
                        </p>

                        <p> 16. Make an effort to be humorous throughout the day. Not only is it beneficial from a
                            physical viewpoint but it diffuses tension in difficult circumstances and creates an
                            excellent
                            atmosphere wherever you are. It was recently reported that members of the Tauripan tribe of
                            South America have a ritual where they awake in the middle of the night to tell each other
                            jokes.
                            Even tribesmen in the deepest sleep wake to enjoy the laugh and then return to their state
                            of
                            slumber in seconds.

                        </p>

                        <p>17. Become a highly disciplined time manager. There are roughly 168 hours in a week. This
                            surely allows plenty of time for achievement of the many goals we desire to accomplish. Be
                            ruthless with your time. Set aside a few minutes each morning to plan your day. Plan around
                            your priorities and focus on not only those tasks which are immediate but not important
                            (i.e.,
                            many telephone calls) but especially on those which are important but not urgent, for these
                            allow for the greatest personal and professional development. Important but not immediate
                            activities are those which produce long-term, sustainable benefits and include exercise,
                            strategic planning, the development of relationships and professional education. Never let
                            the
                            things which matter most be placed in the backseat as compared to those that matter least.
                        </p>

                        <p>18. Associate only with positive, focused people who you can learn from and who will not
                            drain
                            your valuable energy with complaining and uninspiring attitudes. By developing relationships
                            with those committed to constant improvement and the pursuit of the best that life has to
                            offer,
                            you will have plenty of company on your path to the top of whatever mountain you seek to
                            climb.

                        </p>

                        <p>19. Stephen Hawking, one of the great modern physicists of the world, is reported to have
                            said
                            that we are on a minor planet of a very average star located within the outer limits of one
                            of a
                            hundred thousand million galaxies. Are your problems really significant in light of this?
                            You walk
                            this Earth for but a short time. Why not become devoted to having only a wonderful
                            experience.
                            Why not dedicate yourself to leaving a powerful legacy to the world? Sit down now and write
                            out
                            a list of all that you have in your life. Start first with your health or your family - the
                            things we
                            often take for granted. Put down the country we live in and the food we eat. Do not stop
                            until
                            you have written down fifty items. Once every few days, go through this list - you will be
                            uplifted
                            and recognize the richness of your existence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            20. You must have a mission statement in life. This is simply a set of guiding principles
                            which
                            clearly state where you are going and where you want to be at the end of your life. A
                            mission
                            statement embodies your values. It is your personal lighthouse keeping you steadily on the
                            course of your dreams. Over a period of one month, set a few hours aside to write down five
                            or
                            ten principles which will govern your life and which will keep you focused at all times.
                            Examples
                            might be to consistently serve others, to be a considerate citizen, to become highly wealthy
                            or to
                            serve as a powerful leader. Whatever the mission statement of your life, refine it and
                            review it
                            regularly. Then when something adverse happens or someone tries to pull you off course, you
                            quickly and precisely return to your chosen path with the full knowledge that you are moving
                            in
                            the direction that you have selected.
