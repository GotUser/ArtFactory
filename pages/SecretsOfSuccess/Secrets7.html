                                          61. Become an adventurer. Revitalize your spirit and sense of playfulness.
                                          Become a kid again.
                                          Once every few months, plan to enjoy a new, thrilling activity such as white
                                          water rafting, scuba
                                          diving, windsurfing, rockclimbing, joining a martial arts club, sailing, deep
                                          sea fishing or
                                          camping. This will keep your life in perspective, bring you closer to those
                                          you share the activity
                                          with and keep you feeling invigorated and young.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>62. Spend time with Nature. Natural settings have a powerful effect on your
                                          senses which in
                                          turn will lead to a sense of renewal, refreshment and peacefulness. Peak
                                          performers through
                                          the ages have understood the importance of getting back to Nature. Start
                                          camping or simply
                                          taking quiet walks in the forest. Rest by a sparkling stream. Cultivate your
                                          own little garden
                                          which will serve as your personal oasis in the middle of a crowded city. By
                                          cultivating a
                                          friendship with Nature, you will quickly find more serenity, contentment and
                                          richness in your life.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>63. Recall the wise saying "mens sana in corpore sano" which means in a sound
                                          body rests a
                                          sound mind. Never neglect the body which is intimately connected to the mind.
                                          This is your
                                          temple. Feed it the finest fuels, exercise daily and care for it as you would
                                          your prized
                                          possession - because it is.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>64. Be so strong that nothing interferes with your peace of mind. A well-known
                                          boxer was once
                                          unhappy. When asked why, he said that he had allowed himself to think a
                                          negative thought.
                                          Curb your desires and stay centered and focused - it gets easier with
                                          practice. You truly cannot
                                          afford the luxury of even one negative thought.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          65. Do not eat three hours before sleep. This allows for smoother digestion
                                          and a more restful
                                          sleep. For deeper, more renewing sleep, remember that a daily dose of exercise
                                          promotes good
                                          sleep as does a period of relaxation an hour before bed. Also do not bring
                                          work to bed with you
                                          or think about anything which might agitate you. Ease yourself into sleep like
                                          a baby being sung
                                          a soft, soothing lullaby. And finally, as Leonardo da Vinci said: "a
                                          well-spent day brings happy
                                          sleep."
                                    </p>

                                    <p>66. Be careful about your reputation. If it is good it will take you to the
                                          highest of heights. But
                                          once tarnished, it will be difficult to retrieve. Always reflect on your
                                          course of action. Never do
                                          anything you wouldn\'t be proud to tell your mother about. Have fun always but
                                          temper it with
                                          common sense and prudence.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>67. Find mentors to model who will guide you in your progress. The mistakes of
                                          the world have
                                          all been made once before - why shouldn\'t you have the benefit of the
                                          experience of others?
                                          Find someone who has both courage and consideration for others, someone who is
                                          therefore
                                          mature. Your mentor must have only your best interests in mind and should be
                                          sufficiently
                                          senior to offer you good guidance on the subjects you seek assistance with.
                                          Everyone needs to
                                          feel appreciated and even the busiest of executives will find time to assist a
                                          person who
                                          respects them and values their advice.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          68. Make a list of all your weaknesses. A truly confident and enlightened
                                          person will note a
                                          weakness and seek to methodically improve. Bear in mind that even the greatest
                                          and most
                                          powerful people have weaknesses. Some are better than others in hiding them.
                                          On the other
                                          hand, get to know your best qualities and cultivate them.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          69. Never complain. Be known as a positive, strong, energetic and enthusiastic
                                          person.
                                          Someone who complains, is cynical and always looks for the negative in
                                          everything, will scare
                                          people away and rarely will succeed at anything. From a purely psychological
                                          viewpoint, things
                                          are always created twice: once in the mind and then in reality. Focus on the
                                          positive. Be so
                                          mentally tough that nothing takes you off your planned course to success.
                                          Visualize and firmly
                                          believe in what you want. It will most certainly come true.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>70. Overlook the weaknesses of your friends. If you look for flaws you will most
                                          surely find them.
                                          Be mature enough to ignore the petty failings of others and see the good that
                                          each one
                                          inherently possesses. We can learn from everyone. Everyone has a story to
                                          tell, a joke to share
                                          and a lesson to learn. Open your mind to this and you will learn a tremendous
                                          amount. Friends
                                          are so very important to a happy existence - especially those who have shared
                                          many
                                          experiences and laughs with you. Work hard to make friendships, and all your
                                          relationships for
                                          that matter, stronger and richer. Call your friends, buy them small gifts of
                                          books or other items
                                          you believe they might enjoy. The "law of the farm" applies to relationships
                                          as well as to the rest
                                          of life - you reap what you sow and to have great friends you must first be
                                          one.
                                    </p>
