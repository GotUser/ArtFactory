                                    <p>51. Aromas have been proven to be an effective means of entering a state of
                                          relaxation. Scents
                                          have a very noticeable effect on your mindset and moods. Purchase the
                                          essential oils of orange
                                          and clove bud from your local health food shop. Put a few drops of either oil
                                          within a cup of
                                          boiling water and inhale the sweet smelling steam for a few minutes. Then let
                                          the mixture sit in
                                          the room where you are resting. You will gain a sense of peace and serenity. A
                                          little apple spice
                                          in the air has recently been shown to induce a far more restful sleep.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>52. Cultivate the art of walking half an hour after you have finished eating your
                                          evening meal.
                                          Walks in natural settings are the very best. Walking is, perhaps, nature\'s
                                          ideal exercise. And
                                          when you walk, do not think about work or about the bills or about the
                                          challenges you might be
                                          facing - this will neutralize many of the benefits. Simply enjoy the walk.
                                          Notice the richness of
                                          your surroundings. Let your senses drink in the beauty of nature and the
                                          crispness of the air for
                                          a change. So many people who have mastered the art of growing younger have
                                          also mastered
                                          the habit of a daily walk.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>53. Start a program of weight lifting at the gym. Strong people are mentally
                                          tough people. As
                                          you age, you need not lose your physical nor your mental strength. 75 year-old
                                          men are running
                                          marathons, 80 year-old women have scaled mountains and 90 year-old
                                          grandparents are living
                                          rich, productive lives. Whether you are 19 or 93, stay fit, stay motivated and
                                          stay passionate
                                          about life.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>54. Never argue with the person you work for - you will lose more than just the
                                          argument.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>55. In terms of business attire, dark suits (navy blue and charcoal grey) reflect
                                          power,
                                          sophistication and authority. Have you ever seen a prime minister or president
                                          in a tan suit?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>56. Regularly send handwritten notes to your business clients and your other
                                          relations to
                                          strengthen the bond. Develop a system which reminds you to send something
                                          valuable to this
                                          network at least once every four months. Send them postcards when you are away
                                          on vacation.
                                          If you have to buy a few hundred postcards and spend an hour writing, don\'t
                                          worry. This is an
                                          exceptionally good investment of your time. Another idea is to send a recent
                                          article of interest to
                                          your contacts with a handwritten note saying that you thought this would
                                          interest them and that
                                          you continue to value their friendship. Relationship building should always be
                                          a central focus
                                          whether you are a CEO, a student, a salesperson or a parent.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>57. Two of the fundamentals for a happy, joyful life are balance and moderation.
                                          One must
                                          maintain a balance of all activities and do nothing to extremes.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>58. Drink Jasmine tea which can be obtained from any Chinese herbal shop. It is
                                          excellent for
                                          your general health and is very relaxing. Also try placing a few slices of
                                          fresh ginger in a cup of
                                          hot water for a superb tea that will restore vitality and keep you in a peak
                                          physical condition.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>59. Remember that effective time management makes you more rather than less
                                          flexible. It
                                          allows you to do the things that you really want to do rather than the things
                                          you really have to
                                          do.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                          60. Do not take personal development books as gospel. Read them and take
                                          whatever useful
                                          ideas you need. Some people feel they must do everything suggested and take
                                          the techniques
                                          to extremes. Every book has at least one tool or strategy of benefit. Take
                                          what you need and
                                          what works for you and discard what doesn\'t suit you.
                                    </p>
