            </p>
            <p>Money is just a consequence. I always say to my team, 'Don't worry too much about profitability. If you
              do your job well, the profitability will come.'-<b>Bernard Arnault</b></p>
            <p>The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy
              that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.-<b>Mark Zuckerberg</b></p>
            <p>I’ll keep working until the end.-<b>Amancio Ortega</b></p>
            <p>Low interest rates are a big opportunity for investment. But the issue is that this money should go to
              the real economy, not the financial economy.-<b> Carlos Slim Helu</b></p>
            <p>Relentlessly strive to come up with new and better products and produce them more efficiently than the
              alternatives.-<b>Charles Koch</b></p>
            <p>You know, once you've stood up to cancer, everything else feels like a pretty easy fight.-<b>David
                Koch</b></p>
            <p>I believe people have to follow their dreams -<b> I did.-<b>Larry Ellison</b></p>
            <p>America is built around this premise that you can do it, and there are an awful lot of people who are
              unlikely to have done it who did.-<b> Michael Bloomberg</b></p>
            <p>Lots of companies don't succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the
              future.-<b>Larry Page</b></p>
            <p>I feel there's an existential angst among young people. I didn't have that. They see enormous mountains,
              where I only saw one little hill to climb.-<b> Sergey Brin</b></p>
            <p>I learned from my dad that change and experimentation are constants and important. You have to keep
              trying new things.-<b> S. Robson Walton</b></p>
            <p>The leader of the market today may not necessarily be the leader tomorrow.-<b> Ma Huateng</b></p>
            <p>If there are some losses that you take, then we're all big boys -<b> we shouldn't be crying.-<b> Mukesh
                  Ambani</b></p>
            <p>I'm coming to this world not to work. I want to come to this world to enjoy my life. I don't want to die
              in my office. I want to die on the beaches.-<b>Jack Ma</b></p>
            <p>Why do I need succession planning? I'm very alert, I'm very vibrant. I have no intention to
              retire.-<b></b></p>
            <p>When you're running a company, you have employees -<b> lots of them -<b> that can interrupt your
                  schedule. You have customers that can interrupt your schedule. You have a certain obligation to wave
                  the flag because people expect to get out and wave the flag. The number of ways that others can
                  command your time is high.-<b>Steve Ballmer</b></p>
            <p>I am not a person who pursues luxury. I am not like those people who, once they have money, compulsively
              squander it or show it off.-<b>Wang Jianlin</b></p>
            <p>I believe you have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate.-<b> Jeff Bezos</b></p>

            <p>There's no bad time to innovate.-<b> Jeff Bezos</b></p>
            <p>It's important to be willing to make mistakes. The worst thing that can happen is you become
              memorable.-<b> Sara Blakely</b></p>
            <p>We don't have the luxury of time. We spend more because of how we live, but it's important to be with our
              family and friends.-<b> Sara Blakely</b></p>
            <p>We can make the world a better place, one butt at a time.-<b> Sara Blakely</b></p>
            <p>Taxes are not good things, but if you want services, somebody's got to pay for them so they're a
              necessary evil.-<b> Michael Bloomberg</b></p>
            <p>To a contrarian like me, constant advice not to do something almost always starts me quickly down the
              risky, unpopular path.-<b> Michael Bloomberg</b></p>
            <p>I don't know why you should be proud of something. It doesn't make you any better or worse. You are what
              you are.-<b> Michael Bloomberg</b></p>
            <p>There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.-<b> Warren
                Buffett</b></p>
            <p>Of the billionaires I have known, money just brings out the basic traits in them. If they were jerks
              before they had money, they are simply jerks with a billion dollars.-<b> Warren Buffett</b></p>
            <p>If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.-<b> Warren
                Buffett</b></p>

            <p>I believe people have to follow their dreams ,I did.-<b> Larry Ellison</b></p>
            <p>I have had all of the disadvantages required for success.-<b> Larry Ellison</b></p>
            <p>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.-<b> Bill Gates</b></p>
            <p>We make the future sustainable when we invest in the poor, not when we insist on their suffering.-<b>
                Bill Gates</b></p>
            <p>Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.-<b> Bill Gates</b></p>
            <p>When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.-<b> Elon Musk</b>
            </p>
            <p>The only thing that makes sense is to strive for greater collective enlightenment.-<b> Elon Musk</b></p>
            <p>The single best piece of advice: Constantly think about how you could be doing things better and
              questioning yourself.-<b> Elon Musk</b></p>
            <p>Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change.-<b> Larry Page</b></p>
            <p>If you're changing the world, you're working on important things. You're excited to get up in the
              morning.-<b> Larry Page</b></p>
            <p>We don't have as many managers as we should, but we would rather have too few than too many.-<b> Larry
                Page</b></p>
            <p>It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as
              well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default.-<b> J. K. Rowling</b></p>
            <p>It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our
              friends.-<b> J. K. Rowling</b></p>
            <p>It is our choices ... that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.-<b> J. K. Rowling</b></p>
            <p>The worse a situation becomes, the less it takes to turn it around, the bigger the upside.-<b> George
                Soros</b></p>
            <p>Unrestrained competition can drive people into actions that they would otherwise regret.-<b> George
                Soros</b></p>

              their interests compatible with the interests of others.-<b> George Soros</b></p>
            <p>What God intended for you goes far beyond anything you can imagine.-<b> Oprah Winfrey</b></p>
            <p>Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody's going to know whether you did it or
              not.-<b> Oprah Winfrey</b></p>
            <p>Breathe. Let go. And remind yourself that this very moment is the only one you know you have for
              sure.-<b> Oprah Winfrey</b></p>
            <p>The biggest risk is not taking any risk ... In a world that's changing really quickly, the only strategy
              that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks-<b> Mark Zuckerberg</b></p>
            <p>I think a simple rule of business is, if you do the things that are easier first, then you can actually
              make a lot of progress-<b> Mark Zuckerberg</b></p>
            <p>I think that people just have this core desire to express who they are. And I think that's always
              existed-<b> Mark Zuckerberg</b></p>
