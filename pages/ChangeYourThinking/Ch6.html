                            you back. Dreaming big dreams and setting big goals provide the starting point of thinking,

                            &nbspHow you think and feel about yourself is largely determined by how <i>effective</i> you
                            feel you are in
                            the important things you do, especially in your work or career. It is not possible for you
                            to feel happy and
                            confident as a person if you are not competent and capable in the areas of your life that
                            are central to
                            your personal identity. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the most powerful ways for you
                            to change your
                            thinking about yourself is for you to <i>commit to excellence.</i> It is to make the

                            be the best, to join the top 10 percent in your field, no matter how long it takes. The very
                            act of thinking
                            of yourself as <i>potentially</i> excellent at what you do actually changes your mind-set
                            and improves your
                            personality. It makes you happier and raises your self-esteem.You like and respect yourself
                            more, just by

                                <p> <br>Perhaps the most important quality of high-achieving men and women is that of
                                    <i>ambition.</i>
                                    They see themselves, think about themselves, and conduct themselves every day as
                                    though they
                                    were among the elite in their fields. They set high goals for themselves and
                                    continually work to
                                    exceed those goals. For them quotas are minimums, not maximums. They look upon the
                                    accomplishments of everyone else as challenges to themselves to be even better. And
                                    so must you.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe core of your personality is your level of
                                    <i>self-esteem</i>.Your selfesteem is a measure of how much you value yourself, and
                                    how much you
                                    think of yourself as an important and worthwhile person. Your self-esteem is the
                                    power source of
                                    your personality. It determines your levels of energy, enthusiasm, motivation,
                                    inspiration, and
                                    drive.The more you like and respect yourself, the better you do at everything you
                                    attempt. And
                                    the better you do, the more you like and respect yourself. Self-esteem and personal
                                    excellence
                                    reinforce each other. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE BETTER YOU DO</b>
                                <p> <br><i>Self-esteem</i> and <i>self-efficacy</i> are flip sides of the same coin of
                                    personality.
                                    You can genuinely like and respect yourself only when you know, deep in your heart,
                                    that you are
                                    really good at what you do. A sense of <i>personal mastery</i> is absolutely
                                    essential to the
                                    healthy human personality. Every single thing that you do in an excellent fashion
                                    boosts your
                                    self-esteem and makes you feel better about yourself. It makes you feel even more
                                    confident of
                                    performing at even higher levels. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAchieving your full
                                    potential
                                    requires high levels of courage and confidence. Great success requires a continual
                                    willingness
                                    to move out of your comfort zone, and to break the bonds of learned helplessness
                                    that hold most
                                    people back. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe higher your self-esteem, the more
                                    powerful,
                                    positive, and determined you will become. The more you like yourself, the more
                                    willing you will
                                    be to take chances, to step out in faith, and to persist longer than anyone else.
                                    The better you
                                    become in your chosen field, the stronger and more confident you will become in
                                    every other part
                                    of your life as well. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE ABSOLUTE PREREQUISITE</b>
                                <p> <br>The fact is that it is impossible for you to be truly happy or successful until
                                    you know in
                                    your heart that you are very, very good at what you do. For this reason alone, you
                                    must resolve
                                    to overcome any obstacle, pay any price, and go any distance to achieve this level
                                    of
                                    excellence.You must set a goal to be among the top 10 percent of performers in your
                                    field, and
                                    then do whatever it takes to get there. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFortunately,
                                    getting to
                                    the top is easier than you think. The great majority of people seldom think about
                                    personal
                                    excellence. And if the thought crosses their minds, they quickly dismiss it and go
                                    back to
                                    average performance. Most of the people around you are content to do their jobs, for
                                    better or
                                    for worse, and then go out with their friends, or go home and watch television.
                                    However, when
                                    you begin to make those extra efforts that enable you to excel, you will find that,
                                    like a
                                    runner going into a sprint, you soon move ahead of the pack of the average
                                    performers. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DEVELOP THE WINNING EDGE</b>
                                <p> <br>One of the most important of all success principles is the ''winning edge''
                                    concept. This
                                    concept explains success and failure, and has been demonstrated over and over. This
                                    principle
                                    says: <i>Small differences in ability can lead to enormous differences in
                                        results.</i> It seems
                                    that the top people in every field are usually just a little bit better than the
                                    average in the
                                    critical things that they do. But consistency in being a little bit better in your
                                    key skill
                                    areas eventually adds up to an enormous difference in results. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIn
                                    fact, all you need is to be about 3 percent better in each of the key result areas
                                    of your job
                                    to develop the winning edge. This edge enables you to move to the front in the race
                                    of life.
                                    Once you get a little ahead, you can then maintain and increase this gap by
                                    continuous
                                    self-improvement.You can continue to get better and better with learning and
                                    practice.With this
                                    strategy, you will soon emerge in the top 10 percent, or even the top 5 percent, of
                                    people in
                                    your field. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Success in any job requires a minimum level of performance in one or more tasks
                                    or functions.
                                    These are the key result areas (KRAs) of the position. Key results areas are the
                                    tasks that you
                                    absolutely, positively have to do well to be successful in your overall job,
                                    whatever it is. As
                                    it happens, there are seldom more than five to seven key result areas in any job,
                                    position,
                                    company, or area of responsibility. Your job is to identify the KRAs of your job and
                                    then make a

                                    result areas'' is because they are the essential skills necessary for you to do your
                                    job
                                    completely and well. A weakness in any one of them can hold you back from excellent
                                    performance
                                    in your overall job.You are successful because of your strength in certain key
                                    result areas, but
                                    your weakest key result area determines the degree of effectiveness with which you
                                    will be able
                                    to use all the others.Your weakest key skill area largely determines your income.

                            <li><b>IDENTIFY YOUR KEY SKILLS</b>
                                <p> <br>Each job or desired result can be defined in terms of the key skills necessary
                                    to achieve it.
                                    For example, there are seven key result areas in selling. A weakness in any one of
                                    them can hold
                                    you back from selling as much as you can. They are: (1) prospecting; (2)
                                    establishing trust and
                                    rapport; (3) identifying the customer's problem or need; (4) presenting your product
                                    or service
                                    as the ideal solution to the problem; (5) answering objections and concerns; (6)
                                    getting
                                    agreement to proceed; and (7) obtaining resales and referrals. If you perform well
                                    in all seven
                                    of these areas, you will soon be at the top of your field. If you are poor in any
                                    area, your
                                    performance in that area will determine your income. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIn
                                    management, there are also seven key result areas. They are: (1) planning; (2)
                                    organizing; (3)
                                    selecting the right people; (4) delegating; (5) supervising; (6) measuring; and (7)
                                    reporting,
                                    both upward and downward. If you are excellent at every key skill except for one,
                                    that one
                                    weakness alone will hold you back in your career as a manager. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp
                                    &nbspThere are critical success factors in almost every area of life. For example,
                                    there are
                                    four critical success factors that determine your physical health. They are: (1)
                                    proper diet;
                                    (2) proper weight; (3) proper exercise; and (4) proper rest. Almost all of your
                                    health problems
                                    can be traced back to a problem or deficiency in one of these four areas.

                                    &nbsp &nbspThe starting point of personal excellence is for you to identify the key
                                    result areas
                                    of your job. Define them clearly and write them down. Make a list of the tasks, in
                                    order, that
                                    you must perform to get the results expected of you in your job. Evaluate your
                                    current
                                    performance in each of these key result areas.Where are you strong? Where are you
                                    weak? Be
                                    honest. <br><br>
                            <li><b>SET STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE</b>
                                <p> <br>If you want to lose weight, the first thing you do is weigh yourself. If you
                                    want to improve
                                    in any area, you first measure how well you are doing in that area today, and then
                                    use that as a
                                    baseline for improvement. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce you have determined
                                    the results
                                    that you absolutely, positively have to get to perform at your best in a particular

                                    of your life or work, you then give yourself a score of 1 to 10 in each key result
                                    area, with 1
                                    being the lowest and 10 being the highest. You must be at a 7 level or above in each
                                    area to do
                                    your overall job in an excellent fashion. Wherever you are scoring 7 or below, you
                                    must set a
                                    goal to improve in that area. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAlways start your

                                    personal improvement where you can get the greatest result the fastest.This will
                                    invariably be
                                    in the key result area where you are the weakest. Identify your lowest-scoring KRA
                                    and then make
                                    a plan to improve in this skill area as quickly as possible. Simultaneously, you
                                    develop a plan
                                    to gradually improve in each other area where you are weak. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspEvery
                                    step you take toward improving yourself in one of your key result areas will improve
                                    your
                                    results in your job. The better you get at your job, the more you will like and
                                    respect
                                    yourself. The more you like and respect yourself, the better you will feel, and the
                                    more energy
                                    and enthusiasm you will have.You will soon become unstoppable. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PERSONAL STRATEGIC PLANNING</b>
                                <p> <br>In the business world of the twentieth century, it was generally agreed that
                                    corporations
                                    should conduct strategic planning on a regular basis. Individuals, though, were
                                    encouraged to
                                    set personal goals. In the twenty-first century, however, the situation is
                                    different. Today,
                                    each individual, just like a company, must engage in a regular process of personal
                                    strategic
                                    planning. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn personal strategic planning, you view
                                    yourself as a
                                    business organization. With this perspective, you make more detailed, longrange
                                    plans for your
                                    goals and activities in every part of your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspToday, you must
                                    spend far more time thinking about your future than ever before.You must invest more
                                    energy and
                                    effort analyzing and planning the steps you need to take to translate your future
                                    dreams into
                                    present realities.You must manage yourself better than ever before.You have to take
                                    complete
                                    control over everything that happens to you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION</b>
                                <p> <br>Sometimes I ask my audiences, ''How many people here are selfemployed?''
                                    Usually, about 10 to
                                    15 percent of the audience will raise their hands. I then stop the seminar and ask
                                    them again,
                                    ''How many people here are really self-employed?'' And then I wait. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIt doesn't take them very long. People look at each other and then back at me
                                    and then at
                                    each other again. Soon, one hand after another begins to go up. Eventually, everyone
                                    has his or
                                    her hands raised. Everyone realizes that they are all self-employed. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp<i>The biggest mistake that you can make is to think that you ever work for
                                        anyone else but
                                        yourself.</i> The fact is that you are always selfemployed, from the time you
                                    take your
                                    first job until the time you retire. No matter who signs your paycheck, you are
                                    working for
                                    <i>yourself.</i> You are the president of an entrepreneurial personal services
                                    company with one
                                    employee - <i>yourself</i>. In the long run, as a result of the things that you do
                                    or fail to
                                    do, you determine how much you earn. If you want an increase in pay, you can go to
                                    the nearest
                                    mirror and negotiate with your ''boss.'' <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOU DETERMINE YOUR OWN INCOME</b>
                                <p> <br>People sometimes argue with me about this. They say that the pay structures in
                                    their business
                                    or industry are determined by factors over which they have no control. But then I
                                    point out to
                                    them that it was they who decided to go to work in that business or industry. And it
                                    is they who
                                    decide to stay there.They are in charge.They are on their own payroll. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIf you are not happy with any part of your work, it is up to you to change it.
                                    Benjamin
                                    Disraeli said, ''Never complain and never explain.'' If there is a part of your work
                                    or personal
                                    life that you don't like, don't waste your time complaining about it. Instead, take
                                    action. As
                                    Shakespeare's Hamlet expresses it, ''take arms against a sea of troubles, and by
                                    opposing end
                                    them.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSeeing yourself as the president of your own

                                    you are, and
                                    everything you ever will be. This is an enormous thought for many people. It is both
                                    scary and
                                    exhilarating. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust imagine! You are where you are and
                                    what you
                                    are because you have decided to be there. Everything you accomplish, for the rest of
                                    your life,
                                    will be largely determined by the actions that you take, or fail to take.You are
                                    responsible.You
                                    are in charge.You are in control.You are your own boss. And there are no limits
                                    except the
                                    limits that you allow the outside world to place on yourself and on your thinking.

                                    between corporate planning and personal planning are very similar. The purpose of

                                    planning in a business is to achieve the highest <i>return on equity</i> (ROE)
                                    invested in the
                                    business. All strategic plans and tactics are aimed at reorganizing the resources
                                    and activities
                                    of the company in such a way that it achieves a higher rate of financial return on

                                    than it was achieving before. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn its simplest terms,
                                    strategic
                                    planning is aimed at increasing the ratio of outputs to inputs. All of the

                                    popular today, such as <i>restructuring, reorganizing, reengineering, and

                                    aimed at improving the functioning of the organization so that it earns more money.

                                    do.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspLet us say, for example, that you have decided that

                                    double your income in the next three to five years. This is a reasonable goal that
                                    many people
                                    around you are already achieving. It is not that difficult to achieve. Simply put,
                                    to double
                                    your income, you merely have to double the value of your output relative to your
                                    input. You have
                                    to double the value of your contribution. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFinancial

                                    willing to pay for. If you want to increase the amount you get out, you have to make
                                    a plan to
                                    increase the amount you put in. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Some years ago, a friend of mine went to work for a stock brokerage firm. The
                                    recruiting and
                                    training program was highly technical and the sales training was virtually
                                    nonexistent. When he
                                    finally got his brokerage license, he was given the yellow pages and told to begin
                                    ''dialing for
                                    dollars,'' phoning anybody he could get on the other end of the line and pitching
                                    them on his
                                    products. He soon learned that this was one of the hardest ways in the world to
                                    crack the
                                    professional sales field and make a living. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne day
                                    he had a
                                    sudden insight that changed his career, and eventually made him one of the top
                                    financial
                                    advisers in the country. He realized that his entire career, and everything that
                                    happened to him
                                    - his family lifestyle, his bank account, and his future— would be determined by how
                                    good he was
                                    on the telephone. So he made a decision to become absolutely outstanding at using
                                    the telephone
                                    as a prospecting and selling tool. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe read every book
                                    he could
                                    find on effective telephone techniques. He took every course and studied every piece
                                    of
                                    information on the subject. He became so good at using the telephone that he could
                                    recognize 19
                                    different kinds of hesitancy in the voice of the person he was calling. He developed

                                    responses to each one so that he could reassure his prospects and clients that what

                                    than five million dollars per year buying and selling investments for his clients
                                    over the phone
                                    on straight commission. Fully 99 percent of his business is done by telephone and
                                    now by
                                    computer, e-mail, and fax. He seldom meets his clients personally. But on the phone,
                                    he is a
                                    master communicator. He definitely and specifically identified and developed a

                                    and as a result they have no idea what their competitive advantage will be in the

                                <p> <br>Here is the next question: ''What should your competitive advantage be?'' If you
                                    could be
                                    absolutely outstanding in any one area, what should it be? If you're not sure, go
                                    and ask your
                                    boss or your co-workers. Ask them, <i>''If I was really, really good in any one

                                    &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspYou usually know the answer to this question as soon as you ask it. If
                                    you are in
                                    doubt about the one skill that could help you the most, ask for advice and input
                                    from others.The
                                    people around you, especially your boss, can usually tell you quite quickly the
                                    answer to this
                                    question. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce you have the answer, you set the

                                    in that area, and you begin to imagine that you have the ability to be absolutely
                                    outstanding in
                                    that one area.You write it down, set a deadline, make a plan, and go to work on
                                    improving
                                    yourself in that area. In no time at all, you will begin to develop the winning edge

                                    that will enable you to move ahead of the crowd. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Some companies today are taking their people through an exercise that can be
                                    quite traumatic
                                    to their employees. They call everyone together, and then they fire the entire
                                    staff.They
                                    announce that they are going to be rehiring someone for each job, and that each
                                    person can
                                    reapply for their job as though they were outside contractors presenting a proposal.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis proposal for their jobs would include a
                                    description of what
                                    they intend to do, how they intend to do it, how much they would charge for their
                                    work, and how
                                    much the company would gain or save by paying them the salaries they are requesting
                                    for what
                                    they are proposing to do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs you can imagine, many
                                    employees are
                                    completely baffled when they are confronted with this exercise. The very idea of
                                    thinking
                                    through their current jobs and describing them in the form of a business proposal,
                                    along with a
                                    justification for why they should be paid the amount that they are asking, is an
                                    overwhelming
                                    task. Most people have never thought about their jobs in this way before.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspFinally, the boss adds one more detail. He tells them that they will each
                                    be
                                    competing against other people who will also be submitting proposals for the same
                                    jobs. Whoever
                                    offers the company the best deal or price will get the position. <br><br>

                                <p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne way to determine your future is to examine your
                                    past. Look back
                                    to what you most enjoyed doing when you were between the ages of 7 and 14 years old.
                                    At that
                                    time, you were completely free to pursue any subject that attracted you.What did you
                                    most enjoy
                                    doing? If you don't remember, go and ask one of your parents. They will usually
                                    remember how you
                                    spent your time when you were younger. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA participant
                                    in one of my
                                    seminars told me that this principle applied to him exactly. When he was between the
                                    ages of 7
                                    and 14, he loved to build model airplanes. He spent many hours, long into the night,
                                    building
                                    more and more complex models. Soon, he was building model planes with small engines
                                    and entering
                                    them in contests. As he grew older, he built larger planes, remote-controlled, and
                                    flew them in
                                    competitions around the country. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen he finished
                                    high school, he
                                    attended university and earned a degree in aeronautical engineering. He now owns
                                    three
                                    companies. In one company, he designs small aircraft. In a second company he leases
                                    and charters
                                    aircraft, and he owns a third company that does aircraft maintenance. He told me
                                    that he was
                                    worth several million dollars and he felt that he had never done a day's work in his
                                    life. He
                                    was still doing what he most enjoyed doing when he was a young man. And he was only
                                    35 years
                                    old. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR FEELING OF IMPORTANCE</b>
                                <p> <br>Dale Carnegie once wrote, ''Tell me what gives a person his greatest feeling of
                                    importance and
                                    I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.''What gives you your greatest feeling
                                    of
                                    importance? What gives you a heightened sense of self-esteem when you do it
                                    successfully? What
                                    do you most enjoy doing, so much so that you are drawn back to it continuously?
                                    <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNapoleon Hill once said that one of the great secrets of success is
                                    to
                                    <i>decide what it is that you most enjoy doing, and then find a way to earn a good
                                        living at
                                        it.</i> Most people get it backward. They do what they feel they <i>have to do
                                        so</i> that
                                    they can finally acquire the time and money necessary to do what they really <i>want
                                        to
                                        do.</i>Your goal should be to reverse this order.You should do what you really
                                    enjoy doing
                                    from the very beginning. In this way, you will get better and better doing more and
                                    more of the
                                    things that give you your greatest feeling of importance. <br><br>
                            <li><b>FACE THE FACTS</b>
                                <p> <br>One of the most important parts of changing your thinking is the development of
                                    the quality of
                                    courage. I will discuss this subject in greater detail later, in Chapter 12. For the
                                    moment, in
                                    terms of doing what you love to do, you need courage to face the fact that, right
                                    now, you might
                                    not be in the right job, place, or relationship for you.You may be on the wrong
                                    path.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost people back into their jobs and their careers,
                                    and even
                                    their relationships, like backing up their car and hitting something, and then
                                    getting out to
                                    see what it was. They do not have clear goals, so they accept whatever happens to
                                    them. They
                                    take the job that is offered to them at the time they are starting work or making
                                    the transition
                                    from one job to another. They do the work that is assigned to them. They allow their
                                    boss to
                                    determine their career path. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTheir entire work lives
                                    soon become
                                    organized around the expectations of the people who sign their paychecks. If they
                                    are not
                                    careful, years will go by and they will completely lose sight of the child in them
                                    who started
                                    off in life with hopes and dreams, entering a world of untapped possibilities and
                                    potentialities. <br><br>
                            <li><b>BE TRUE TO YOURSELF</b>
                                <p> <br>Joseph Campbell, the late professor of mythology, told a story on the Bill
                                    Moyers Special
                                    television show some years ago. It took place in a small local restaurant that he
                                    patronized
                                    with his wife. One day another couple, along with their young son, came in and sat
                                    down for
                                    dinner at a nearby table. Halfway through the meal, the boy spoke up and said that
                                    he didn't
                                    like his dinner, and he wasn't going to eat it.The father became extremely angry and
                                    insisted
                                    that he eat it whether he liked it or not. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe boy
                                    refused and
                                    said to his father, ''But I don't want to eat it!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspAt this, the
                                    father blew up and shouted, ''You don't want to? What does that have to do with
                                    anything? I
                                    never did anything I wanted to do in my whole life!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspCampbell
                                    went on to point out that many people are in that same situation. Many people feel
                                    that they
                                    have lived their whole lives doing things that other people wanted them to do
                                    because they never
                                    had the courage to do just what they wanted. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspCampbell
                                    then said
                                    that the key to success and happiness in life was to ''follow your bliss.'' It was
                                    to do what
                                    you most loved to do. It was to look over the landscape of your life and determine
                                    those
                                    activities that you enjoyed doing more than anything else, the things that you would
                                    do if you
                                    had no limitations, and then to build your life around those activities. <br><br>
                            <li><b>BE PREPARED TO WALK AWAY</b>
                                <p> <br>Many of the happiest men and women in our society today are those who, at a
                                    certain point, got
                                    up and walked away from a situation that they finally realized was not making them
                                    happy or
                                    fulfilled. They had the courage to decide that they were going to do what they loved
                                    to do,
                                    rather than what they felt they had to do. They looked deep within themselves and
                                    honestly
                                    assessed their own natural talents and abilities. This often changed their whole
                                    lives. <br><br>
                            <li><b>LISTEN TO OTHERS</b>
                                <p> <br>Some years ago, I began thinking in earnest about what it was that I really
                                    wanted to do. My
                                    current job was coming to an end, and the prospects for the future, because of the
                                    economy, were
                                    not very encouraging. Meanwhile, although I had a very good idea of what I wanted to
                                    do, I
                                    wasn't sure. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt this point, I suddenly asked a friend
                                    of mine
                                    what he thought I would be good at doing. He replied, without a moment's hesitation,
                                    ''You'd be
                                    excellent at teaching and giving seminars.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThat
                                    turned out to
                                    be exactly what I had been thinking, but I was nervous about directing my whole
                                    career into a
                                    completely unknown field. My friend's comment made me realize that often the people
                                    around you
                                    can see clearly what you should be doing, even if you can't see it yourself.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIf you are at all unsure about your area of natural talent and ability,
                                    ask someone
                                    who knows you well what he or she thinks your ideal line of work would be. The
                                    people who know
                                    you and care about you will often give you ideas and insights that change your whole
                                    life. Often
                                    these insights will reveal to you your heart's desire. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR HEART'S DESIRE</b>
                                <p> <br>Your heart's desire is that one special thing that you were put on this earth to
                                    do. No one
                                    else can do it in the same way that you can. It is something that may have been
                                    calling to you
                                    for many years, like the sound of distant music. It is something that has interested
                                    you and
                                    attracted you since you were young. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerhaps you have
                                    never told
                                    anyone about it. Perhaps, deep in your heart, you were afraid of the enormous
                                    changes you would
                                    have to make to pursue your heart's desire. But the fact is that you will never be
                                    truly happy
                                    or satisfied until you let yourself go and throw your whole heart into whatever it
                                    is.

                                    looking at someone else. You plan every part of your life, knowing that no one is

                                    for you. Especially, you establish your own program for personal and professional

                                <p> <br>There are several concepts in personal strategic planning that can improve your

                                    change your life. As in everything, these are ways of thinking that lead to ways of
                                    acting more
                                    effectively. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DRAW A LINE</b>
                                <p> <br>The first concept is what I call ''zero-based thinking.'' Call a timeout in your
                                    life and
                                    work. Draw a line under all your current activities. Now, imagine that you are
                                    starting over.
                                    Ask yourself, <i>''Is there anything in my life that, knowing what I now know, I
                                        would not get
                                        into or start up again today if I had it to do over?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp
                                    &nbspThis is one of the most important questions you will ever ask and answer.You
                                    can apply it
                                    on a ''go forward'' basis to each part of your life. Often the biggest problem in
                                    personal
                                    strategic planning is your attempting to make something work that you wouldn't even
                                    get into in
                                    the first place if you had to do it over again. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOften
                                    when I
                                    consult with companies, they ask me for advice on how to increase sales of a
                                    particular product
                                    or service. I always ask them, <i>''Knowing what you now know, would you introduce
                                        this product
                                        or service again today if you had it to do over?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThey
                                    often tell me that, knowing what they now know, they would never have brought it out
                                    in the
                                    first place. My advice to them is always the same: ''Kill it.'' One of the smartest
                                    things a
                                    company can do with a part of the business that is not working, and which has no
                                    future, is to
                                    discontinue it as quickly as possible. This applies to products, services,
                                    processes, methods of
                                    sale or advertising, investments, or any other area of activity that consumes time,
                                    money, or

                                <p> <br>Everything in life is a trade of some kind. Overall, you trade your time for the

                                    ''trader'' than the other. One person has better information, continually upgrades

                                    and begins to pull ahead of the pack. Soon, he is working and earning at a far

                                    four areas will determine your income and your future. They are: (1) specialization;
                                    (2)
                                    differentiation; (3) segmentation; and (4) concentration. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThese

                                    offered by any business anywhere. All business growth and profitability are the
                                    result of
                                    performing well in each of these areas. Problems with sales and profitability are
                                    the result of
                                    a weakness in one or more of these areas. Each of them applies to you and your

                                <p> <br>Specialization means that you decide exactly what it is that you are going to

                                    in your field. Successful people in every field specialize rather than generalize.
                                    They focus
                                    their time and talents rather than trying to do too many things. They work to
                                    develop a
                                    reputation for being very, very good in a specific area. They don't try to be all

                                    specialize in a particular type of customer or in a specific market. It may
                                    specialize in a
                                    particular product or service for that type of customer. A successful salesperson
                                    will
                                    specialize in selling a particular product or service to a particular type of
                                    customer. A

                                    the primary determinant of success in your career. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspDifferentiation is defined as the way that you separate yourself from everyone

                                    of excellence, your area of uniqueness, your unique selling proposition. It is what
                                    gives you a

                                    explain how and why your product or service is superior to that of your competitors,
                                    what would
