                        <p> <br>The Law of Correspondence is perhaps the most important of all laws in determining your
                            success or failure in
                            life. As we've discussed in previous chapters, this law says that your outer world is a
                            reflection of your inner
                            world. It says that whatever you are on the inside, you will soon see the results of it on
                            the outside. When you
                            change your thinking, you change your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis law applies
                            to everything you do.
                            Your inner world of knowledge and preparation will determine your outer world of income and
                            career success.Your
                            inner world of personality development will determine your outer world of friendships and
                            relationships.Your inner
                            attitudes toward health and fitness will determine the condition of your physical body.Your
                            inner beliefs and
                            expectations will determine your outer attitudes and your behaviors toward other people.Your
                            outer world will always
                            reflect your inner world. <br><br>
                            <li><b>HAPPINESS IS THE SUPREME GOAL</b>
                                <p> <br>Aristotle, perhaps the greatest of the philosophers, wrote more than 2,300 years
                                    ago that the ultimate aim
                                    of all human action is happiness. He concluded that everything a person does is to
                                    achieve happiness of some
                                    kind. Sometimes they are successful, and sometimes they are unsuccessful, but
                                    happiness is always the target
                                    each person aims at. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe concluded that every act is
                                    merely an interim step in the
                                    direction of happiness. For example, you want to get a good job.Why? So you can earn
                                    good money.Why? So you can
                                    get a comfortable home and a nice car.Why? So you can have good relationships and a
                                    nice family. Why? So that
                                    you can have a satisfying home life. Why? The final answer, the ultimate goal, is so
                                    that you can be happy.
                                    Everything that you or anyone else does is aimed at happiness, however you define it
                                    and however successful you
                                    are at achieving it. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE ROLE OF GOODNESS</b>
                                <p> <br>One of Aristotle's greatest insights on the subject of happiness was his
                                    conclusion that ''Only the good
                                    can be happy, and only the virtuous can be good.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThis is one of the most
                                    important observations in the history of human thought and experience. ''Only the
                                    good can be happy, and only
                                    the virtuous can be good.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat I have found in my
                                    many years of research into
                                    philosophy and psychology is that only people who are genuinely good inside can be
                                    happy for any period of time.
                                    And in my years of study of the foundation qualities of self-confidence, I have
                                    found that only men and women
                                    with clear, positive values are able to develop the kind of unshakable
                                    self-confidence that makes it possible
                                    for them to deal effectively with anything that happens to them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe fastest way
                                    for you to build or to regain your self-confidence is to become absolutely clear
                                    about your deepest values and
                                    convictions, and then begin to live by them. The solution to almost all human
                                    problems is a return to values. In
                                    many ways, your unhappiness and stress are caused by your drifting away from doing
                                    and saying the things that
                                    you know are right. <br><br>
                            <li><b>INTEGRITY IS ESSENTIAL</b>
                                <p> <br>The most important single quality for success is the quality of
                                    <i>integrity.</i> Aristotle insisted that
                                    only a life based on values such as integrity, honesty, courage, generosity,
                                    persistence, and sincerity would
                                    lead to happiness and personal fulfillment. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI used to
                                    think of integrity as only
                                    one of the key values, equal to and separate from the others.Then one day a wise and
                                    wealthy man pointed out to
                                    me that integrity is really the value that guarantees all the others. <i>Integrity
                                        is the foundation value on
                                        which all of your other values are based. Having true integrity means that you
                                        always live and act
                                        consistently with your values. If you lack integrity, you will compromise your
                                        other values at the slightest
                                        temptation.</i> <br><br>
                            <li><b>CLARIFY YOUR VALUES</b>
                                <p> <br>In our strategic planning sessions, both for corporations and for individuals,
                                    we start off by asking
                                    people to define and clarify their values.You must do the same in your own personal
                                    strategic planning. What are
                                    <i>your values</i>? What is it that you believe in? What do you stand for? What will
                                    you<i> not</i> stand for?
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour ability to clearly define your values is the
                                    starting point of your
                                    developing the kind of character that causes people to want to be associated with
                                    you and which will lead you
                                    inevitably to enjoying a good life.When you have a fine and noble character, rooted
                                    in solid, life-affirming
                                    values, you will be a genuinely good person. As a result, you will be happy inside,
                                    no matter what is going on
                                    around you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>ORGANIZE YOUR VALUES</b>
                                <p> <br>Once you have defined your values, you should organize them in order of
                                    priority.To start, you need only
                                    three to five key values to create a foundation for your character and personality.
                                    These are the values that
                                    you personally consider to be more important than any others. The order in which you
                                    arrange your values is
                                    terribly important as well. This ranking of values largely determines the kind of
                                    person you are, and the kind
                                    of life you live. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEverything you do is the result of
                                    a choice.You are constantly
                                    making choices of one kind or another, to do one thing or to do something else. This
                                    ability to make choices
                                    distinguishes you from all other creatures. Each choice you make is based on your
                                    primary values at that time.
                                    Each action is based on what you consider to be the most important value at that
                                    moment of choice. <br><br>
                            <li><b>ACT ON YOUR VALUES</b>
                                <p> <br>When you choose, your higher-order values always take precedence over your
                                    lower-order values. Every act
                                    you take, every decision you make, is based on your dominant value at that time.You
                                    can do only one thing at a
                                    time, and you always have to choose what it is going to be.You always choose what is
                                    most valuable to you at
                                    that particular moment. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHow can you tell what your
                                    values are? It's simple.Your
                                    values are only and always expressed in your <i>actions.</i> It is what you do
                                    rather than what you say that
                                    tells you, and others, what you value most. Especially, it is what you do <i>under
                                        pressure</i>, when you are
                                    forced to choose, that reveals your true values and beliefs about yourself and the
                                    world around you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE DETERMINANT OF PERSONALITY</b>
                                <p> <br>Both your choice of values and the order of your values are critical in
                                    determining your personality and
                                    your life. Here is an example. Imagine that two people have each been through a
                                    values clarification exercise
                                    and settled upon the same three values. Only the order is different. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerson A has
                                    decided that his top three values, in order of importance, are first, family;
                                    second, health; and third, career
                                    success. This person is saying that he puts his family ahead of his health and
                                    career, and his health ahead of
                                    his career. This means that if he has to choose between family and career, family
                                    comes first. If he has to
                                    choose between health and career, health comes first. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspPerson B has the same three
                                    values, except that his values are in a slightly different order. His first value is
                                    career success. His second
                                    value is his family, and his third value is health. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThis means that Person B will
                                    put his career ahead of his family if he has to choose. He will put his career and
                                    his family ahead of his
                                    health if he has to choose. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE BIG QUESTION</b>
                                <p> <br>Now here are some questions for you. Will there be a difference between Person A
                                    and Person B? Will there
                                    be a <i>small</i> difference or a <i>large</i> difference? Would you prefer to be
                                    friends with Person A or with
                                    Person B? Would you be able to tell Person A from Person B if you met them socially
                                    or in business?
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe answer is that Person B, who chooses career
                                    success as his primary value,
                                    will be a totally different human being from Person A, who decides that his family
                                    is most important to him. The
                                    order of family, health, and career is a life-enriching organization of values. A
                                    person who lives his life
                                    consistent with these values will be a far happier person than a person who places
                                    his career ahead of his
                                    family and especially ahead of his health. This is why you must select both your
                                    values and their order of
                                    importance with care.Your values and their order determine your whole life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>INTEGRITY IS A WAY OF LIVING</b>
                                <p> <br>Once you have determined your values, your level of integrity can be measured by
                                    how rigidly you adhere to
                                    them. A value is not something that you compromise when it is convenient. Either you
                                    have it or you do not.Your
                                    choice of values and your resolution to live by those values form your character and
                                    your personality.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThroughout history, great men and women have been men
                                    and women of character.
                                    They have been people who lived on the basis of high and noble values.They have been
                                    honored and respected for
                                    the values they stood for and represented. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the
                                    great problems in our
                                    society today is the phenomenon of ''situational values'' or ''situational ethics.''
                                    These are the result of
                                    people changing their ideas of right and wrong depending on the situation, and often
                                    the temptation of the
                                    moment.What is even worse is when they fool themselves into believing that they are
                                    people of character when
                                    they are really only people of convenience. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Situational values are demonstrated when people say they believe in one thing,
                                    but they do another. They
                                    say that they believe in telling the truth, but then they lie when it is convenient,
                                    or excuse the lies of
                                    another. An individual is defined by what he or she does, not what he or she
                                    <i>says</i>. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspSome people are confused by their emotions. They believe that if their
                                    <i>intentions</i> are sincere,
                                    their <i>actions</i> don't matter. They feel that if they wish or hope something, it
                                    is the same as actually
                                    doing it. But it is only what you actually do when you are forced to choose,
                                    especially under pressure, that
                                    tells you who you really are inside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt is vital to
                                    your success and happiness
                                    that you are impeccably <i>honest</i> with everyone you know and deal with, both in
                                    your personal life and in
                                    your career. There is nothing that will earn you the support of people faster than
                                    for you to develop the
                                    reputation of being a person of character and integrity. At the same time, there is
                                    nothing that will damage
                                    your reputation and sabotage your career faster than for you to get the reputation
                                    of being the kind of person
                                    that others cannot trust or rely on. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Honesty means that you are always true to the very best that is in you. As
                                    Polonius says in Shakespeare's
                                    <i>Hamlet, ''To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day,
                                        thou canst not then be false
                                        to any man.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBeing true to yourself is the
                                    starting point of developing a
                                    great character.This begins with your always living in truth with yourself. You do
                                    not delude yourself or play
                                    games with your own mind.You don't try to believe things that are completely
                                    impossible.You don't hope and pray
                                    that things would be different than they are.You deal with the world as it is, not
                                    as you wish it were. <br><br>
                            <li><b>ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST</b>
                                <p> <br>Every job bears the signature of the person who did it. Being true to yourself
                                    means that you always do
                                    your very best at whatever job or responsibility you take on. Honesty and integrity
                                    on the inside are expressed
                                    as quality and excellence in your work on the outside.You can tell what you are made
                                    of on the inside by the
                                    amount of time and attention that you put into doing the very best job possible at
                                    everything that is given to
                                    you to do. Don't take it on unless you are willing to do it in an excellent fashion.

                                    &nbspIntegrity means that you are always truthful, straightforward, and honest with
                                    everyone in your life. Just
                                    as you are true to yourself, you are true to others as well.You <i>live in truth</i>
                                    with others, at home and at
                                    work. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you ask people whether they are honest,
                                    almost everyone will say that
                                    they are. Most people do not lie, cheat, steal, or engage in dishonest behaviors of
                                    any kind. But being truly
                                    honest means that you are honest with everyone in your life. This means that not
                                    only do you never lie; you
                                    never live a lie.You never stay in a situation that is wrong for you or in a
                                    condition that undermines your
                                    integrity or makes you unhappy.You never compromise your integrity by biting your
                                    lip and refusing to say what
                                    you truly think and feel. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR HIGHEST GOAL</b>
                                <p> <br>One of the hallmarks of the truly honest person is that they set peace of mind
                                    as their highest goal. Once
                                    you have set peace of mind as your primary aim in life, you organize your other
                                    goals and activities around it.
                                    Being truly honest means that you refuse to compromise your peace of mind for
                                    anything or anyone.You only do and
                                    say the things that you feel to be right in every situation. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspHonesty and
                                    integrity mean that you listen to yourself and that you trust your <i>inner
                                        voice</i>.You listen to your
                                    intuition and you let it guide you to do and say the right things at the right
                                    time.When you are disturbed or
                                    unhappy, you sit quietly by yourself in solitude, waiting and listening for the
                                    guidance that always comes.When
                                    you get an idea or insight into the right thing to do, you put it into action. You
                                    trust your higher mind. This
                                    is the key to living in truth with yourself and others. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR OWN MIND</b>
                                <p> <br>Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his essay ''Self-Reliance,'' said, <i>''Guard your
                                        integrity as a sacred
                                        thing.''</i> He went on to say, <i>''Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity
                                        of your own mind.''</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTruthfulness is the indispensable requirement for the
                                    development of character,
                                    and the development of character must be a central aim of your life. Aristotle said,
                                    <i>''The purpose of
                                        education is the development of the character of the young.''</i>Today, in the
                                    United States, many young
                                    people have not been brought up with a clear sense of right and wrong. Many people
                                    have been told that values
                                    are relative. Many people have been told, for example, that if they like to
                                    shoplift, then that particular value
                                    is just as good as a person who believes that shoplifting is wrong. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis form of
                                    value relativity leads down a blind alley. It leads to failure, frustration, and
                                    unhappiness. The fact is that
                                    values are not relative. There are values that are <i>life-enhancing</i> and there
                                    are values that are
                                    <i>life-destroying.</i> If a value is positive, living by it improves the quality of
                                    your life and your
                                    relationships with others. A negative value hurts your relationships and detracts
                                    from the quality of your life.
                                    You can easily tell the difference, because living by a positive value makes you
                                    feel happy, and practicing a
                                    negative value makes you feel unhappy. <br><br>

                                    about your work and your relationships. You look yourself directly in the eye and
                                    you live consistently with
                                    your innermost convictions.You do not play games with yourself or wish and hope that

                                    If you want things to
                                    change, you are going to have to make the changes yourself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp

                                    <i>people don't change.</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn fact, under pressure, people not only do not
                                    change, but they become even more
                                    of what they already are inside. If a person has a difficult personality, under
                                    pressure he will become even
                                    more difficult. If someone is stubborn or inflexible, when she is put under pressure
                                    she will become even more
                                    stubborn and inflexible. If a person is slightly dishonest, when he is subjected to
                                    pressure or temptation he
                                    will become totally dishonest. People don't change. <br><br>
                            <li><b>BUSINESS AND COMPETITION</b>
                                <p> <br>Honesty in our fast-moving world also means that you see the world of business
                                    and competition as it is,
                                    not as you wish it were, especially with regard to the explosion of information and
                                    technology. Many people
                                    think that they can make a token effort to keep up with the growth of knowledge in
                                    their field and the growth of
                                    technology in their work. But this minimum effort is not acceptable to the honest
                                    person. The truly honest
                                    person realizes that today you have to run just to stay in the same place. The truly
                                    honest person realizes that
                                    knowledge is doubling in every field every two to three years, and this means that
                                    your knowledge has to double
                                    every two to three years as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJack Welch, the
                                    past president and CEO of
                                    General Electric, once said, ''If the rate of change outside your organization is
                                    greater than the rate of
                                    change inside your organization, the end is in sight.'' This principle applies to
                                    you as a person as well. If
                                    you are not continually learning and upgrading your skills, you are in danger of
                                    becoming obsolete. <br><br>
                            <li><b>WHAT ARE YOU WORTH?</b>
                                <p> <br>All over the country today, people are being laid off or fired by the thousands,
                                    and even hundreds of
                                    thousands, each year. In many cases, these people have allowed their levels of
                                    knowledge and skill to decline to
                                    the point where their companies could no longer afford to keep them on the payroll.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspMany of them were not completely honest with themselves. They did not
                                    continually upgrade their knowledge
                                    and skills so they could continue to add more and more value to their companies.
                                    They hoped that the dramatic
                                    changes taking place in the national and international economies would not affect
                                    them. And as a result, they
                                    got caught in the layoffs when the market for their products or services slowed
                                    down. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIt takes the average white-collar professional two to seven months to find
                                    another job, usually taking a
                                    pay cut of 14 to 40 percent. Some people get laid off from highly paid jobs and
                                    never make that kind of money
                                    again. And if they don't get busy upgrading their knowledge and skills, it can
                                    happen again. <br><br>
                            <li><b>FOCUS ON ADDING VALUE</b>
                                <p> <br>Honesty means that you accept that your income is totally determined by your
                                    ability to contribute value
                                    to your company and, through your company, to your customers. An individual must
                                    generate three dollars of
                                    bottom-line profit for every dollar of salary or income that the person earns from
                                    the company. If you are not
                                    currently generating three dollars of profit or cost savings to the bottom line for
                                    your company, your job is a
                                    prime candidate for outsourcing, downsizing, or eliminating. Honesty means that you
                                    accept this as a fact and
                                    then do everything in your power to maintain and increase your value. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTrue
                                    honesty means that you never expect to get out more than you put in.You never expect
                                    to get something for
                                    nothing.You don't gamble or buy lottery tickets, which in a way is an act of
                                    dishonesty. It is an attempt to get
                                    something that you have not earned. The truly honest person never attempts to get
                                    rewards without working, or to
                                    get rich quick or easy. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn the United States today,
                                    millions of people are
                                    attracted to the <i>quick fix.</i> If they are employees or executives, they want
                                    new and better jobs, and they
                                    want them immediately. They are always looking for shortcuts, and as a result they
                                    are always frustrated and
                                    unhappy. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey hope that problems that have taken many
                                    months and years to develop
                                    can be solved with a <i>silver bullet</i> of some kind.They are impatient and they
                                    want immediate results. But
                                    being an honest person requires that you resist the temptation of the quick fix in

                            <li><b>TRUST IS THE GLUE</b>
                                <p> <br>Relationships are central to a happy, healthy, satisfying life. All
                                    relationships are based on trust.
                                    Trust is the glue that holds relationships together. You can have all kinds of
                                    problems and disagreements with
                                    another person, but as long as the trust and respect are still there, the
                                    relationship can endure. But, if
                                    anything ever happens to the trust, the relationship can fall apart quickly, like a
                                    house of cards collapsing.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAll business relationships are based on trust. All
                                    relationships that involve
                                    money are dependent on the word of the borrower or the creditor. All relationships
                                    with your bankers, your
                                    suppliers, your customers, your staff, and everyone else in your financial world are
                                    based on that critical
                                    element of trust. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMen and women of high integrity are
                                    fastidious about the levels
                                    of trust that they have built and maintained. They are careful about their credit,
                                    and about their financial
                                    commitments and arrangements. They always keep their word. They are careful about
                                    their banking relationships,
                                    their credit cards, their bills, and any money that they owe at any time. <br><br>
                            <li><b>A TALE OF TWO BANKRUPTCIES</b>
                                <p> <br>Some years ago, two people I knew well, in two different businesses, were forced
                                    into bankruptcy because
                                    of the economic downturn. But the outcomes of their bankruptcies were completely
                                    different. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe first of my friends had been meticulously careful about all of his
                                    bills and finances throughout
                                    his career. He had always paid at least the minimum amounts on his charge cards. If
                                    ever he had a financial
                                    problem, he went to the person affected and rearranged payments and interest.When he
                                    was finally forced into
                                    bankruptcy, by a massive and unexpected financial default over which he had no
                                    control, he had no choice but to
                                    go to court, give up all his assets, and walk away penniless. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspBut within a week,
                                    people were approaching him and offering him money, loans, offices, credit cards, a
                                    place to live, and a new
                                    car. One of his previous business associates, quite wealthy, mailed him a blank
                                    check already signed, saying,
                                    ''Just fill in the amount you need and let me know for my records; I have complete
                                    faith in you.'' Aside from
                                    removing a great burden of debt from him, his bankruptcy hardly affected him at all.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe second businessman, however, had a completely different experience. When he
                                    started to have financial
                                    problems, he continually misled and deceived his creditors, people who had trusted
                                    him. He neglected to make
                                    payments he had promised, and wrote checks that he couldn't cover. He avoided his
                                    creditors when they phoned,
                                    and he eventually changed his telephone number. He moved and didn't tell anyone his
                                    new address. He treated
                                    people who had trusted him by lending him money as if they were stupid. When he
                                    finally went bankrupt, no one
                                    wanted anything to do with him. It will take him years to recover, if he ever does.
                                    He can't even get a credit
                                    card; he now has to pay cash for everything. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE KEY TO SALES SUCCESS</b>
                                <p> <br>In sales, trust is the foundation of all relationships. A person will not buy
                                    from you until he or she
                                    trusts you completely. All top salespeople invest a good deal of time building
                                    high-quality, trusting
                                    relationships with their clients before they ever attempt to sell their products or

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn association to which I belong commissioned a $50,000 survey of
                                    customers last year. Since
                                    most of our organizations sell forms of training and consulting services that are
                                    somewhat similar, they wanted
                                    to find out what caused a purchaser to buy from one company and not another.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne
                                    of the questions they asked the customers was what they were most concerned with in
                                    making a buying decision.
                                    More than 80 percent of the respondents to the survey said that the honesty and
                                    integrity of the salesperson was
                                    more important than any other factor. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen they asked
                                    them what they meant by
                                    honesty and integrity in a salesperson, the customers replied that this meant that
                                    the salesperson put their
                                    interests first. They believed that the salesperson would keep his or her word. They
                                    believed the salesperson's
                                    claims about the product. They believed that the salesperson would do what he or she
                                    promised, and that the
                                    company would fulfill any commitments that the salesperson made. They had a high
                                    level of confidence in the word
                                    of the salesperson and in everything that he or she did or said in interactions with
                                    them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspAn interesting fact that came out of this survey was that the quality of
                                    the product or service was
                                    hardly mentioned. When customers were asked about their concerns over product
                                    quality, they replied that they
                                    felt that most products or services at a particular level were fairly similar and
                                    would achieve the results
                                    offered. The key to the sale was how they felt about the character of the
                                    salesperson, and through the
                                    salesperson, the company itself. <br><br>
                            <li><b>TRUTHFULNESS IS THE KEY TO CHARACTER</b>
                                <p> <br>The real essence of character, and the most recognizable expression of honesty
                                    and integrity, is
                                    <i>truthfulness.</i> If you are completely truthful with yourself and others, you
                                    will almost always be viewed
                                    as a person of high character. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn our society, men
                                    and women of character seem to
                                    attract opportunities. Doors are opened for them wherever they go. They are
                                    introduced to people who can help
                                    them. Money and other resources are made available to them. This is why the most
                                    important quality you can
                                    instill in your children is a sense of honesty and the habit of truthfulness in
                                    everything they do or say.

                            <li><b>PARENTS AND CHILDREN</b>
                                <p> <br>I have four children. Each of my children has been brought up having the
                                    importance of truthfulness
                                    drummed into them from an early age.Today, all four of them are adamant truth
                                    tellers.They are completely
                                    honest. I can ask them any question and they will always tell me the truth.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen
                                    they were growing up, I made them each a promise. I said, ''You will never get into
                                    trouble with me for telling
                                    the truth.'' And I kept my word. When they did something foolish, as all children
                                    do, I would listen to their
                                    stories without judging or criticizing and then ask, ''Well, what did you learn?''
                                    They soon learned that they
                                    could always tell the truth and never suffer criticism or disapproval. They loved
                                    it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspSometimes they fool around, but all I have to do is ask them for the truth and
                                    they will always give it to
                                    me, whatever it is. I'm very proud of them. It is absolutely amazing how much better
                                    relationships are between
                                    parents and children when they absolutely trust each other. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>What is true for communications between parents and children is even more
                                    important for husbands and
                                    wives. One of the best definitions of love that I have ever heard is by Ayn Rand:
                                    ''Love is a response to
                                    values.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou love another person because he or she
                                    represents values that you
                                    respect and cherish. The other person embodies qualities that you admire. In short,
                                    you love another person for
                                    his or her character. All else will change or fade away over time, but character
                                    remains. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspTruthfulness and honesty between couples requires fidelity and
                                    straightforwardness between the two at
                                    all times. If a couple is ideally suited, they absolutely trust each other and are
                                    each other's best
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspfriends. There is no one that they would rather talk
                                    to or express themselves
                                    more honestly with than the other. Character, integrity, and honesty are the
                                    foundation qualities of a loving
                                    relationship, and are more important than anything else. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>There is a wonderful test that you can give yourself on a regular basis to
                                    measure whether an act is good
                                    or bad, right or wrong. It is simple and you can use it throughout life. It is based
                                    on the Universal Maxim of
                                    the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, postulated more than 200 years ago. He said
                                    that <i>you should live your
                                        life as though your every act were to become a universal law.</i> <br><br>&nbsp

                                    going to do exactly the same
                                    thing. Imagine that your decision was going to become a law for yourself and
                                    everyone else. This is the true
                                    test of whether your decision is a good one. It is the true test of a value or

                                    business if there was a likelihood that everyone would engage in those actions.

                                <p> <br>Here are some questions that you can ask yourself on a regular basis: First, ask
                                    yourself, <i>''What kind
                                        of a world would my world be if everyone in it were just like me?''</i> Just
                                    imagine! If everyone in the world
                                    were just like you, would this be a better world in which to live? If everyone in
                                    the world were just like you,
                                    would this be a happier, healthier, more prosperous, and more harmonious world - or
                                    not? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThen, ask yourself, <i>''What kind of a country would my country be if
                                        everyone in it were just like
                                        me?''</i> What would this country be like if everybody in it behaved exactly the
                                    way you do? If everyone did
                                    the things that you do in your daily life and work, would this be a better country?
                                    Or are there some things
                                    that you might do differently? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe third question you
                                    can ask yourself is,
                                    <i>''What kind of a company would my company be if everyone in it were just like
                                        me?''</i> Look around you in
                                    your company and ask yourself if your company would be more prosperous and
                                    harmonious if everybody in it did
                                    their work exactly the way you do your work all day long. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe final question that
                                    you can ask yourself is, <i>''What kind of a family would my family be if everyone
                                        in it was just like me?''</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf all the members of your family were just like you,
                                    would your family be a
                                    wonderful place to live and grow up in? Would everybody in your family thrive and be
                                    happier and more
                                    successful? Would you have the kind of family that other people would point to and
                                    admire and want to be like?
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that no one can answer <i>''yes''</i> to
                                    all of these questions. Each
                                    of us is a <i>work in progress</i>. Each of us has a long way go. Each of us has a

                            <li><b>THE QUALITY OF COURAGE</b>
                                <p> <br>In a review of 3,300 studies of leadership conducted by James McPherson over the
                                    years, he found a common
                                    denominator. It was the quality of courage. Winston Churchill once said,
                                    <i>''Courage is rightly considered the
                                        foremost of the virtues, for upon it, all others depend.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou have heard
                                    it said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.The world is full of
                                    people with high and lofty
                                    goals and ambitions, but there are very few people who have the courage, the
                                    discipline, and the willpower to
                                    carry them out. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe best part of practicing the
                                    quality of courage is that each
                                    time you behave courageously, you feel stronger and better about yourself.Your
                                    self-esteem increases and you
                                    like yourself more.You feel more confident and competent.You feel happier inside.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIn contrast, each time you compromise yourself in the area of courage your
                                    self-esteem goes down.You feel
                                    weaker and less competent. You don't like or respect yourself as much. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DO THE THING YOU FEAR</b>
                                <p> <br>A fundamental part of becoming personally powerful requires that you live
                                    consistently with the highest
                                    values you know, in every area of your life. These virtues and values not only are
                                    self-reinforcing, they also
                                    are self-rewarding.You get an immediate payoff of inner satisfaction each time you
                                    force yourself to do what you
                                    know you should do, even when you don't feel like it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe fear of failure is the
                                    greatest single obstacle to success in adult life. The antidote to the fear of
                                    failure is the courage to take
                                    action. Courage is so important as a quality that, like physical fitness, it
                                    requires a series of exercises to
                                    build it and maintain it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou best way to develop
                                    courage is by facing your
                                    fears. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, <i>''Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear
                                        is certain.''</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you do the thing that you are afraid of, you
                                    take control over both your
                                    emotions and your life.You shift your attitude from neutral or negative to positive
                                    and optimistic. ''Do the
                                    thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.'' <br><br>
                            <li><b>PRACTICE SYSTEMATIC DESENSITIZATION</b>
                                <p> <br>Many people fear public speaking. But Toastmasters International has developed a
                                    powerful method of
                                    teaching public speaking even to people who are absolutely terrified of the idea of
                                    standing up and speaking in
                                    front of others. It is the process of ''systematic desensitization.'' You can use it
                                    in every area of your life
                                    to reduce fear and build courage. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSystematic
                                    desensitization is a psychological
                                    term that refers to your doing something over and over again until it no longer
                                    holds any fear for you. In
                                    Toastmasters International, each member is required to stand up and speak, even if
                                    just for a few seconds, at
                                    every meeting. After several months of weekly meetings, people who were so terrified
                                    of speaking in front of
                                    others that they could not lead silent prayer in a phone booth become so confident
                                    about their ability to stand
                                    up and speak in front of peers that they compete for longer opportunities to talk.

                                <p> <br>I have worked with countless executives who have taken my advice and joined
                                    Toastmasters International or
                                    taken a course from the Dale Carnegie organization. Within six months, they tell me
                                    that they are completely
                                    different people. From being shy and self-effacing at meetings and in presentations,
                                    they become calm,
                                    confident, bold, and even eloquent in expressing their points on their feet with
                                    other people. And their careers
                                    take off as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you can speak on your feet,
                                    you appear to be smarter and
                                    more competent than a person who cannot. Many executives, both men and women, have
                                    seen their careers take off,
                                    their incomes increase, and their responsibilities expand as they faced their fears
                                    by speaking over and over
                                    again and until they became very good on their feet. <br><br>
                            <li><b>TURN TOWARD DANGER</b>
                                <p> <br>On the Serengeti Plain of Africa, zoologists have developed a simple technique
                                    to determine which one of
                                    the animals in the herd is the leader. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen a
                                    predator - a lion or cheetah -
                                    approaches a herd of grazing animals, the members of the herd pick up the scent in
                                    the wind and begin drifting
                                    away in the opposite direction. At this time, the leader of the herd will emerge.The
                                    leader will be the animal
                                    that places himself between the predator and the herd while the herd begins to
                                    flee.The leader, risking his life
                                    facing the lion or cheetah that is moving in on the herd, will nonetheless stand his
                                    ground to buy time for the
                                    others to escape. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe leader always ''turns toward
                                    danger.''This is as true for
                                    human beings as it is for animals.You become a leader to the degree to which you
                                    force yourself to turn toward
                                    danger as well. You identify the areas in your life that cause you fear and stress,
                                    and instead of avoiding them
                                    and hoping that they will go away, you confront them directly. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DO IT ANYWAY</b>
                                <p> <br>The actor Glenn Ford once said, <i>''If you do not do the thing you fear, the
                                        fear controls your
                                        life.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt is almost as if the fear is the
                                    puppeteer and you are the
                                    puppet. If you don't deal with the fear,and cut the strings that hold you to the
                                    fear, the fear will cause you
                                    to dance emotionally and psychologically. If you let a fear go on for too long, it
                                    will tend to grow and grow
                                    and eventually come to dominate all of your thinking. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspEach time you think of the
                                    fearful situation or person, your heart will beat faster and your stomach will
                                    churn.You will be unable to sleep
                                    well at night. The fear will affect your health, your happiness, your relationships,
                                    and your interactions with
                                    your customers and coworkers. Over time, you will become so preoccupied with the
                                    fearinducing situation that you
                                    will not be able to think of anything else. This is no way to live. <br><br>
                            <li><b>FACE THE FEAR</b>
                                <p> <br>The way you deal with fear is to confront the fear.You resolve to face the fear,
                                    deal with the fear, and
                                    put an end to the fear. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I was a young man and
                                    confronted with a fearful
                                    situation, I read a quote from Mark Twain that changed my attitude forever. It said,
                                    <i>''Courage is not lack of
                                        fear or absence of fear. It is mastery of fear, control of fear.''</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThose
                                    words had an enormous impact on me. I realized that we are all afraid of many
                                    things.To be afraid is normal and
                                    natural. In fact, the more intelligent you are, the greater number of possible fears
                                    you will have.You will have
                                    a greater sensitivity to your world and to the things it is logical for you to fear.
                                    <br><br>
                            <li><b>MOVE TOWARD THE FEAR</b>
                                <p> <br>The only difference between the brave person and the coward is that the brave
                                    person confronts the fear
                                    and deals with it while the coward turns from the fear and flees from it.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAnd
                                    here is a great discovery. When you confront a fear and move toward it, it
                                    diminishes and grows smaller. It
                                    loses its hold over you. But if you back away from a fear, it grows larger and soon
                                    takes control of your
                                    thoughts and feelings. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you habitually turn
                                    toward danger, do the thing you
                                    fear, face the fear, and move toward it bravely, it loses its power to affect you.
                                    Soon you dominate the fear
                                    rather than having it dominate you. You feel a tremendous sense of control. The
                                    quality that you need to face
                                    your fears, more than anything else, is the quality of self-discipline.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspWonderfully enough, when you discipline yourself to face your fears, to act
                                    courageously, even when you
                                    don't feel like it, your fear situation goes away. You will feel terrific about
                                    yourself. You will have a sense
                                    of power and control over your life. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>The first part of courage is the courage to launch in the direction of your
                                    goal. It is the ability and
                                    willingness for you to set a goal and then take the first step in the direction of
                                    achieving it. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn a 12-year study at Babson College, entrepreneurial instructor
                                    Dr. Robert Ronstadt searched
                                    for the reasons for success or failure among the graduates of the business school.
                                    Some went on to build
                                    successful businesses, but most did not. He discovered that those who built
                                    successful businesses had a special
                                    quality. It was that they had the courage to launch their businesses with no
                                    guarantees of success. They were
                                    willing to risk failure in the pursuit of their dreams. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspProfessor Ronstadt called
                                    this the ''corridor principle.'' He said that when you launch toward your goal,
                                    however distant, you begin to
                                    move down a corridor of time. As you move down this corridor, other doors of
                                    opportunity will open up on either
                                    side of you. But you would not have been able to see these other doors of
                                    opportunity if you were not already in
                                    motion down this psychological corridor toward your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspMost people who succeed
                                    in life achieve their success in an area completely different from the field in
                                    which they started off. But
                                    because they were in motion, they saw opportunities and possibilities that they
                                    would not have been aware of if
                                    they had waited until everything was just right. And the fact is that everything
                                    will never be just right.

                                    of courage is the
                                    willingness to <i>endure</i>. It is the courage to hang in there. It is the courage
                                    to stay the course. It is
                                    the courage to persist in the face of every setback and difficulty. <br><br>&nbsp

                                    and uncertainty. It is self-discipline, and the courage that comes from
                                    self-discipline, that develops personal
                                    power within you that enables you to overcome any obstacle in your way. <br><br>

                                        exciting, worthwhile goals is so overwhelming that they quit before they even
                                        begin. But this is not for you.
                                        Sit down, write out your goals as if anything were possible for you, and never
                                        be afraid to dream big dreams.

                                    <li><b>Make a Commitment</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second type of
                                        courage is the courage to make a
                                        total commitment, throwing yourself wholeheartedly into whatever it is you
                                        decide to do. All successful people
                                        of my experience are people who are living fully engaged. They are fully
                                        involved in their lives and in their
                                        goals. They don't do things by half measures. They may have no guarantees, but
                                        they are not afraid to put
                                        their whole hearts into their activities. If they fail, they fail by trying
                                        greatly, not by playing it safe,
                                        wishing and hoping that everything will work out all right. <br>
                                    <li><b>Move out of Your Comfort Zone</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe third
                                        type of courage you need is
                                        the courage to move out of your comfort zone. It is the courage to move into
                                        your zone of discomfort, where
                                        you feel awkward, clumsy, and alone. The comfort zone is one of the greatest
                                        enemies of human potential. When
                                        people get into a comfort zone, they strive to stay in that comfort zone. Often
                                        their whole lives pass them by
                                        while they are furnishing and reinforcing their little rut of medium
                                        performance. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspYou need the courage to continually move yourself in the direction of your
                                        biggest goals and
                                        ambitions.You need to be willing to face discomfort in order for you to grow.

                                        take a stand, especially with regard to your values, your vision, and your
                                        beliefs. You need to stand up for
                                        what you believe to be right.You need to stand up for other people who espouse
                                        those principles.You need to
                                        have the courage to stand solidly for the highest values that you know, and then
                                        refuse to compromise yourself
                                        or your character because others may disapprove. <br>
                                    <li><b>Step Out in Faith</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou need the courage to

                                        who have a dream and set a goal,
                                        make a plan and take the first step, with no assurances and no guarantees that

                                        success. However, if you look upon every step forward as a learning experience
                                        and every setback as a valuable
                                        lesson that has been sent to you to make you stronger and better, you will not
                                        be afraid to launch in faith
                                        into the unknown. <br>

                                        to endure constant setbacks, disappointments, and temporary defeats. You need to
                                        learn to deal with failure by
                                        realizing that it is an in dispensable prerequisite for success.You need the
                                        courage to treat failure as an
                                        opportunity to more intelligently begin again. You need to overcome the fear of
                                        failure by doing the things
                                        you fear over and over again, and then by resolving to bounce rather than break
                                        when things don't work out for
                                        you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe bigger and more exciting the goals you
                                        set for yourself, the more
                                        times you will trip and fall. But as long as you have clear goals, you will
                                        always be failing and falling in a
                                        forward direction. You will always be picking yourself up a little bit closer to
                                        the goal than you were

                                    <li><b>Face Your Fears</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou need the courage to

                                        continuously. Identify all the fear situations in your life that cause you
                                        stress or anxiety today. Decide
                                        what the worst possible outcome of each of those situations might be. Resolve to
                                        accept the worst, should it
                                        occur. And then take action to resolve each of those situations. Refuse to allow
                                        a fear situation to remain in
                                        your life, dominating your thinking and emotions and holding you back. <br>

                                        zero-based thinking continuously in your life. Ask yourself, ''Is there anything

                                        if you had it to do over again. And you always know when you are dealing with a

                                        aside and embark upon something completely different. This is the mark of

                                        they make a mistake, they
                                        accept it, learn as much as possible from it, and then continue on. Remember,
                                        you can learn to succeed only by
                                        failing and making mistakes. The more you fail and the more mistakes you make,
                                        the smarter you become and the

                                        longer than anyone else. Persistence is the quality that will ultimately
                                        guarantee your success.Your
                                        willingness to persist in the face of every adversity can be your greatest
                                        asset. It can be the one factor
                                        that guarantees your success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you refuse to
                                        quit, you must ultimately
                                        succeed. Just as in baseball, you won't ultimately hit a home run unless you
                                        keep on swinging. In 30 years of
                                        studying successful people, I have discovered one fact over and over. No one was
                                        ever defeated until they
                                        accepted defeat as a reality. No one can ever defeat you but yourself.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you
                                        discipline yourself to do what you should do, whether you feel like it or not,
                                        and you use this inner strength
                                        to build high levels of courage and persistence within yourself, you will become
                                        an incredibly powerful
                                        person.You will soon feel that there is nothing that you cannot accomplish.You
                                        will eventually develop
                                        yourself to the point where you feel completely unstoppable.
                                    <li><b>YOU ARE ULTIMATELY SELF-MADE</b>
                                        <p> <br>Someone once said, ''I'm a self-made man, but if I had to do it over,
                                            I'd bring in a little help.''You
                                            and I are all self-made.We all have a lot of areas in which we could
                                            improve.We all need to set higher
                                            standards for ourselves.We all need to work continually on the development
                                            of our characters. We all need to
                                            strive to become better people.We can never allow ourselves to be complacent
                                            at any level of
                                            accomplishment.We have to keep raising the bar on ourselves. <br><br>&nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the marks
                                            of superior people is that they can manage themselves. If they work for a
                                            company, they might do this by
                                            imagining their boss sitting next to them, observing them and filling out
                                            their annual performance appraisal
                                            every minute of every day. Or, by seeing themselves as role models, they
                                            might set far higher standards for
                                            themselves than anyone else could set for them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbspOnly the top 2 percent of
                                            people in our society can supervise and manage themselves. They can conduct
                                            themselves throughout the day as
                                            though everyone is watching, even though no one is watching.
                                    <li><b>THE REAL PAYOFF</b>
                                        <p> <br>When you set high standards for yourself, your self-esteem and
                                            selfrespect increase.When you decide
                                            that you are going to live consistently with your highest values and your
                                            deepest convictions, you feel
                                            wonderful about yourself. When you become completely honest, you stop
                                            compromising yourself in your
                                            relationships with others. You speak sincerely to everyone with whom you
                                            live and work. You practice
                                            absolute truthfulness with yourself and others. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbspThe more honest you are with
                                            yourself, the greater courage and self-confidence you will have. You will
                                            become more positive and
                                            enthusiastic about yourself.You will develop a tremendous feeling of inner
                                            power and personal strength. The
                                            more you live consistently with the very highest values you know, the finer
                                            your character will become.
                                            Eventually, you will reach the point where you are absolutely unstoppable!
