                            &nbsp &nbspYou have
                            complete control over only one thing in the universe - your thinking! You can decide what
                            you are going to think
                            in any given situation.Your thoughts and the way you interpret any event trigger your

                            negative.Your thoughts and feelings lead to your actions and determine the results you get.
                            It all starts with
                            your thoughts. <br><br>
                            <li><b>POSITIVE THINKING</b>
                                <p> <br>Positive thoughts are life enhancing. They <i>empower</i> you and make you feel
                                    stronger and more
                                    confident. Positive thinking is not just a motivational idea. It has measurable,
                                    constructive effects on
                                    your personality, your health, your levels of energy, and your creativity. The more
                                    positive and
                                    optimistic you are, the happier you will be in every area of your life.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspNegative thoughts bring about the opposite. They <i>disempower</i> you and make
                                    you feel weaker and
                                    less confident. Whenever you think or say something negative, you give your power
                                    away. You feel angry
                                    and defensive. You feel frustrated and unhappy. Over time, negative thinking can
                                    make you physically
                                    ill, and even poison your relationships. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPositive
                                    thinking leads to
                                    mental health and peak performance. Negative thinking leads to mental illness and
                                    decreased
                                    effectiveness. Your goal, therefore, if you want to live a wonderful life, is to
                                    cultivate positive
                                    emotions and get rid of negative emotions. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                    elimination of negative
                                    emotions is the most important single step you can take toward health, happiness,
                                    and personal
                                    wellbeing. Each time you take complete control over your thoughts and feelings, and
                                    discipline yourself
                                    to keep them positive, the quality of both your inner and outer lives improves. In
                                    the absence of
                                    negative emotions, your mind automatically fills with the positive emotions that
                                    generate feelings of
                                    happiness and fulfillment. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR THOUGHTS</b>
                                <p> <br>The Law of Substitution says, <i>''Your mind can hold only one thought at a
                                        time, positive or
                                        negative.You can substitute a positive thought for a negative thought whenever
                                        you choose.''</i> You
                                    can apply this law by deliberately thinking about something positive whenever you
                                    want to cancel out a
                                    thought or feeling that makes you angry or unhappy. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe Law of Habit
                                    says, <i>''Any thought or action that you repeat over and over will eventually
                                        become a new habit.''</i>
                                    When you repeatedly react and respond in a positive way, you take full control over
                                    your conscious mind.
                                    Soon it becomes automatic and easy to think and act in that manner. By using
                                    willpower and repetition,
                                    you develop new habits of thinking and acting. By applying this law, you can become
                                    a completely
                                    positive person and change your life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>STARVE YOUR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS</b>
                                <p> <br>Your negative emotions have all been learned, beginning in childhood. And what
                                    has been learned can
                                    be unlearned, sometimes quite quickly.You can learn any habit or skill that you
                                    consider to be either
                                    desirable or necessary. Especially, you can learn positive, constructive ways of
                                    thinking about people,
                                    money, health, and other factors to cancel out negative ideas that limit your
                                    potential and interfere
                                    with your success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany negative ideas or attitudes
                                    are based on false
                                    premises. Sometimes a negative idea about a subject, or a negative attitude toward a
                                    person, can be
                                    completely reversed with a single piece of new information. You could suddenly learn
                                    that an idea you
                                    had about yourself or another person was not true. As a result, you could change
                                    your thinking in an
                                    instant. Be open to this possibility. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNegative
                                    emotions exist only
                                    because we give them life and then keep them alive. We feed them by continually
                                    thinking and talking
                                    about things that make us angry or unhappy. Fortunately, you can change this
                                    situation by applying the
                                    Law of Emotion. This law states, <i>''A stronger emotion will dominate and override
                                        a weaker emotion,
                                        and whichever emotion you concentrate on grows and becomes stronger.''</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspWhat this means is that whatever emotion you dwell upon grows and eventually
                                    dominates your
                                    thinking in that area. If you withdraw your mental energy from a person or situation
                                    that makes you sad
                                    or angry by refusing to think about it, the emotion connected with that situation
                                    eventually dies away.
                                    Like a fire with no fuel, it goes out. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou have
                                    experienced this many
                                    times already. For example, as we grow up, we have relationships with the opposite
                                    sex. Most of them do
                                    not work out over time.When they end, we are often emotionally distressed and
                                    hurt.We are often sad,
                                    angry, depressed, preoccupied, and unhappy. These feelings last for a certain
                                    period. Then we recover.We
                                    meet someone else. Gradually we forget about the unhappy ending of the earlier
                                    relationship. Months or
                                    years later, we look back or even meet the other person, and we cannot imagine how
                                    emotionally involved
                                    we were with him or her. Because we did not feed them, the feelings have died away
                                    completely. This is
                                    an example of the laws of substitution and emotion in action in your own life.

                            <li><b>THE SOURCES OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS</b>
                                <p> <br>There are four basic causes of negative emotions. According to the Russian
                                    philosopher Peter
                                    Ouspensky, in his book In Search of the Miraculous, these are: (1) justification;
                                    (2) identification,
                                    (3) inward considering, and (4) blame. The greatest leap forward in changing your
                                    thinking and changing
                                    your life will take place when you systematically eliminate all four of these causes
                                    of negative
                                    emotions from your life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>STOP JUSTIFYING</b>
                                <p> <br>Justification is what you do when you rationalize or create a reason for your
                                    anger and
                                    unhappiness.You tell yourself, and whoever else will listen, how badly you were
                                    treated and how
                                    dreadfully the other person behaved. You continually rehash the situation in your
                                    mind.You repeat all
                                    the reasons you have for being upset. Each time you think of the person or
                                    situation, you become
                                    angry.You feel entitled to your anger, as if you have paid a high price for it,
                                    especially since, in
                                    your estimation, you were such a good and virtuous person. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe way you
                                    short-circuit the natural tendency toward justification and rationalization is by
                                    refusing to engage in
                                    it. Instead, you stop justifying.You use your marvelous mind to think of reasons not
                                    to justify your
                                    negative emotions. Remember, your negative emotions do you no good. They are totally
                                    destructive. They
                                    do not affect the other person or change the situation. They simply undermine your
                                    happiness and
                                    self-confidence, making you weaker and less effective in other areas of your life.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspInstead of justifying your anger and unhappiness, you should use your
                                    intelligence and
                                    imagination to excuse the other person, or to let go of the unhappy situation. For
                                    example, if someone
                                    cuts you off in traffic, instead of becoming angry, you say,''Well, I'd better be
                                    more careful next
                                    time,'' ''I guess he is having a bad day,'' or ''He must be late for an important
                                    appointment.''
                                    <br><br>
                            <li><b>MAKE EXCUSES FOR OTHERS</b>
                                <p> <br>Since your mind can hold only one thought at a time, the instant you start
                                    excusing the other person
                                    you withdraw the energy or fuel that the negative emotions of anger and resentment
                                    require to get going
                                    and stay burning.You reassert your mental control. You keep yourself calm and
                                    positive. In a little
                                    while, the situation passes and you forget all about it. By substituting a positive
                                    thought for a

                                    you have a major life problem, such as a divorce, a lost job, or a failed
                                    investment, the same rule
                                    holds true. Stop telling yourself (and anyone who will listen) why you are entitled
                                    to be angry or
                                    unhappy. Instead, make excuses for the other person each time you think about the
                                    situation until the
                                    negativity dies away. When the fire of negative emotion goes out, you can then turn
                                    your attention to
                                    something positive. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the most important rules

                                    happiness is, ''Don't be upset or worry about something that you can't do anything
                                    about.'' Don't
                                    criticize anyone for something that the person cannot change. A famous law says,
                                    ''If there is no
                                    solution, there is no problem.'' <br><br>

                                <p> <br>There are two time periods in life, the past and the future. The present is only
                                    a brief, fleeting
                                    moment. You can choose to focus your attention on what has happened, which cannot be
                                    changed, or on the
                                    future, on what is possible, over which you have some control. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspMany
                                    people spend most of their emotional energies being upset and angry about events
                                    that occurred in the
                                    past. Unfortunately, this energy is completely wasted. Nothing good can come of
                                    constantly complaining
                                    about the past. Even worse, the negative emotions kept alive by reliving past events
                                    rob you of the joy
                                    and excitement that you could experience by thinking about future possibilities.

                                <p> <br>A psychiatrist with more than 25 years' experience working with unhappy people
                                    wrote that the two
                                    most common words he heard in his practice were the words ''if only.'' It seemed
                                    that most unhappy

                                    of. They are still
                                    resentful, angry, or depressed over something that someone did or did not do or
                                    say.They are angry with
                                    one or both parents, a sibling, a previous relationship or marriage, a boss or
                                    business relationship, a
                                    failed investment or financial mistake. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is
                                    that your life will
                                    be a continuous series of problems, difficulties, setbacks, and temporary failures.
                                    These unexpected and
                                    unwanted reversals and disappointments are a normal, natural, and unavoidable fact
                                    of growing up.To
                                    change your thinking and change your life, you must make a decision to get over them
                                    and to get on with
                                    your life, no matter what happened. Until you do, you remain a slave to the past,
                                    which cannot be
                                    changed in any case. Make a decision today that, from now on, you are going to
                                    eliminate all the ''if

                                <p> <br>The author and speaker Wayne Dyer says, ''It's never too late to have a happy
                                    childhood.'' He means
                                    that at any time you can reinterpret the unhappy events of your early life in a
                                    positive way.You can
                                    practice the Law of Substitution and look into those negative experiences for
                                    something good, and think
                                    about that instead. You can focus on how your unhappy experiences have made you a
                                    better, wiser person.
                                    You can actually be grateful to people who have hurt you in the past because they
                                    have made you so much
                                    stronger in the present. And in any case, it could not have happened otherwise.

                                    &nbsp &nbspYour parents had no experience with raising children. In addition, they
                                    were a product of the
                                    way they were raised. Like all humans, they came to parenting with their problems
                                    and weaknesses, just
                                    as you have today. Nonetheless, they did the best they could with what they had.
                                    They were the people
                                    they were, and they could not have raised you any differently than they did. It is
                                    silly to continue to
                                    be unhappy about things they did or didn't do that they were incapable of doing
                                    otherwise. Let it go and
                                    get on with your life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY</b>
                                <p> <br>The second major cause of negative emotions according to Ouspensky, is
                                    identification, or
                                    attachment. This occurs when you take something personally or you become attached to
                                    a person or thing.
                                    You see the unhappy outcome of an event or circumstance as a personal affront or
                                    attack on you or on
                                    something you believe in or hold dearly. You become emotionally involved in a
                                    situation and identify so
                                    strongly with it that it affects your emotions and your reason in a negative way.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe great spiritual teachers, such as Buddha and Jesus, have emphasized
                                    the importance of
                                    separating yourself emotionally from the situation (disidentification), in order to
                                    regain your calmness
                                    and composure. Psychologist and philosopher William James of Harvard wrote, ''The
                                    first step in dealing
                                    with any difficulty is to be willing to have it so.'' He encouraged people to say,
                                    ''What cannot be
                                    cured must be endured.'' In other words, practice detachment from any person or
                                    situation that makes you
                                    feel angry or upset. Withdraw the emotional energy from it so that you can regain
                                    your calmness and
                                    composure. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis approach does not suggest that you
                                    passively accept
                                    anything that happens to you. Instead, it encourages you to use your willpower to
                                    keep your mind and
                                    emotions under control.You discipline yourself to stand back mentally and deal with
                                    the problem
                                    intelligently. You use your mind to see the situation objectively and make better
                                    decisions to resolve
                                    it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNothing and no one can have any control over you
                                    unless there is
                                    something you still want from them. They must have something that they can still
                                    give you or withhold
                                    from you. As soon as you detach emotionally from a person or object and no longer
                                    want anything from
                                    them, you are free. This ability to practice detachment is a power you can develop
                                    through practice. It
                                    can make you the master of a situation that might otherwise cause you to become
                                    upset and angry.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the kindest things you can do to help others
                                    is to encourage them
                                    to stand back from a problem situation and be objective about it. Encourage them to
                                    view the difficulty
                                    as if it was happening to someone else. Ask them what advice they would give to
                                    another person who was
                                    facing this same problem. By detaching from the emotionally charged situation, you
                                    and others will
                                    become much more capable of dealing with it effectively. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</b>
                                <p> <br>The third major cause of negative emotions, according to Ouspensky, is <i>inward
                                        considering.</i>
                                    This occurs when you become overly concerned with the way people are treating you.
                                    If you perceive that
                                    someone is not giving you the respect that you feel you deserve, you can feel
                                    insulted and angry, and
                                    want to strike back. If people are rude or indifferent to you, you can experience
                                    their behavior as an
                                    attack on your personality or character. This interpretation of their attitude or
                                    behavior can make you
                                    angry or depressed. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPsychologists say that everything
                                    we do is to
                                    increase our selfesteem and sense of personal value, or to protect it from being
                                    diminished by other
                                    people or circumstances. If your self-esteem is not as high as it could be, you will
                                    be sensitive to the
                                    actions and reactions of other people toward you.You will take everything
                                    <i>personally</i>, exactly as
                                    if what they said or did was consciously and deliberately directed at you. However,
                                    this is seldom the
                                    case. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that most people are preoccupied
                                    with themselves and
                                    their own problems. As much as 99 percent of the time, people are wrapped up in
                                    their own thoughts about
                                    themselves. They devote the other 1 percent of emotional energy they have available
                                    to everyone else in
                                    the world, including you. The person who cuts you off in traffic is so involved with
                                    his own thoughts,
                                    he is not even aware of your existence. It would be silly to become angry or upset
                                    over his thoughtless
                                    action. <br><br>

                                        because you are concerned about what people might think about you. The fact is
                                        that nobody is even
                                        thinking about you at all.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOf course, I am
                                    not talking about
                                    criminal or antisocial behaviors. But it is amazing how many people make decisions
                                    to get into or to not
                                    get into relationships, businesses, new endeavors, adventures, and other things for
                                    fear that someone
                                    else might not approve. They stay in marriages they hate, they work at jobs they
                                    dislike, or they turn
                                    down business opportunities for fear that someone, anyone, might criticize them. The
                                    truth is that no
                                    one cares more about your key life decisions than you do. Plan accordingly.

                                    &nbspIn Abraham Maslow's studies of self-actualizing people, those 1 or 2 percent of
                                    men and women who
                                    are fully mature, fully functioning adults, he found a particular quality that they
                                    all had in common:
                                    <i>They were completely honest with themselves.</i> They were objective and clear
                                    about their own
                                    strengths and weaknesses. They did not hope or pretend that they were other than
                                    they were. This
                                    self-acceptance was a foundation stone of their self-esteem and self-respect.

                                    &nbspBecause they knew who they were, and who they were not, they did not feel that
                                    they had to
                                    continually earn the approval of others. They took the opinions of others into
                                    consideration, but then
                                    they made their own decisions. They were not overly influenced by the possible
                                    approval or disapproval
                                    of other people.You should do the same.You are the one who cares the most and who is

                                <p> <br>When Somerset Maugham, the famous English author, was asked by a reporter for
                                    his chief motivation
                                    for writing, he replied, ''I write to earn the respect of the people I respect.''
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that much of what you do, or fail to do, is influenced by the
                                    same concern.You do
                                    many things in your social life to earn the respect of the people you respect, or at
                                    least not to lose
                                    it. In fact, the people whose respect is most important to you largely determine how
                                    good you feel about
                                    yourself, both at home and at work. The respect of others has an inordinate
                                    influence on your
                                    self-esteem because it is so closely linked to your self-ideal and your self-image.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspExceptional men and women look up to and seek the respect of men and
                                    women of character and
                                    accomplishment. They strive, at an unconscious level, to behave and to live up to
                                    their ideals of how an
                                    excellent person would behave. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the most
                                    important decisions you
                                    make as you go through life is to decide for yourself the specific people whose
                                    respect is of the
                                    greatest value to you. Once you are clear about who you respect and why you respect
                                    them, you can then
                                    organize your life in such a way that you continually earn that respect, whether
                                    they know of your
                                    actions or not. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE RESPECT OF OTHERS</b>
                                <p> <br>In the famous book In His Steps, by Charles M. Sheldon (Christian Library,
                                    1984), an entire town
                                    agrees, prior to every act or decision, to ask the question, ''What would Jesus
                                    do?'' and then to behave
                                    accordingly. The eventual outcome for the townspeople was that the problems that had
                                    divided them were
                                    soon solved and the town became happy and prosperous. They created an ideal for
                                    themselves and then
                                    built their lives around living up to it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn a study
                                    of successful men
                                    and women, most of whom had started from humble beginnings, researchers found that
                                    these people had
                                    almost all been avid readers of biographies and autobiographies when they were
                                    young. As they read the
                                    life stories of famous men and women, they imagined themselves having the same
                                    qualities and characters
                                    of the people they were studying. When they became adults themselves, those
                                    qualities and virtues had
                                    become part of their thinking and guided their choices and decisions in later life.

                                    &nbsp &nbsp<i>Modeling</i> has been used as a powerful way to develop personality

                                    throughout history.Young people have been encouraged to study school heroes and
                                    heroines, and emulate
                                    them as much as possible. In the military, the heroic acts of soldiers and sailors
                                    from the past are
                                    taught as part of the curriculum, encouraging young soldiers and sailors to think
                                    and act like them when
                                    the situation demands it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The people you most admire

                                <p> <br>There is nothing wrong with being thoughtful and concerned about the feelings
                                    and reactions of
                                    others toward you and your choices. When you select admirable people to look up to,
                                    you develop an inner
                                    guide that leads you to conduct yourself in an excellent way yourself. <br><br>&nbsp

                                    &nbspWhat is silly and self-defeating however, is for you to allow yourself to be
                                    inordinately
                                    influenced by the fleeting opinions of people whose regard and respect is of no
                                    concern or value to you.
                                    If you have been raised with destructive criticism, you can easily slip into the
                                    trap of organizing your
                                    life around trying to gain the approval, or escape the disapproval, or people you
                                    don't even know or
                                    care about. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is the way to avoid this form of
                                    negative emotion:
                                    Decide for yourself the men and women you most admire, and the qualities they have
                                    that you would most
                                    like to emulate. From now on, when you have to make a decision, think about someone
                                    you admire and ask,
                                    ''What would he or she do in this situation?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen
                                    you ask this
                                    question, you actually connect at an unconscious level with a higher power that will
                                    then give you
                                    guidance and insight. You will experience a deep inner knowing of exactly the right
                                    thing to do or say.
                                    You will make the right decision and achieve the desired result. This is a technique
                                    used by many
                                    successful men and women. Give it a try and see what happens. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE WORST NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF ALL </b>
                                <p> <br>The fourth major cause of negative emotions, according to Ouspensky, and the
                                    trigger of anger,
                                    resentment, envy, jealousy, and frustration of any kind is blame. It is blame
                                    especially that generates
                                    anger, the worst of all the negative emotions. Anger is more destructive than any
                                    force in the human
                                    world. Uncontrolled anger destroys health, relationships, families, businesses, and
                                    societies, and is
                                    the chief generator of wars, revolutions, and social conflict. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe
                                    primary cause of anger can be traced back to destructive criticism in early
                                    childhood. Whenever a person
                                    is criticized, he reacts exactly as if he is being attacked, with defensiveness and
                                    resentment. Since
                                    any behavior that you repeat over and over becomes a habit, many people develop the
                                    habit of responding
                                    with anger to every problem, disappointment, or frustration they experience.
                                    Eventually, they reach the
                                    point where they are always angry about something. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTo
                                    become angry, a
                                    person must be able to blame someone for something that has happened or not happened
                                    that they don't
                                    like or approve of. Many people are so preoccupied with blaming others for their
                                    problems that they lose
                                    contact with reality. They see the entire world through a lens of blame and its
                                    sister emotion, guilt.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhenever there is a problem, personal or public, the
                                    angry person
                                    automatically concludes that someone must be to blame. The individual then spends
                                    his time and emotion
                                    apportioning blame among various parties. This obsession with blame and anger,
                                    leading to resentment and
                                    envy, can often consume the person who experiences it. <br><br>

                                    they no longer want to live together, blame must be apportioned. Someone must be
                                    guilty. The guilty
                                    party must be punished. Lawyers and judges now have to get involved. Detectives and
                                    accountants are
                                    hired to dig up dirt on each party. The situation gets worse and worse, until it
                                    finally ends in anger,
                                    bitterness, accusations, and even hatred. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe best of
                                    solutions, when a
                                    marriage or a relationship does not work out, is to accept that fact as an
                                    unfortunate reality, make
                                    reasonable provisions for each party, and then for each person to get on with his or
                                    her life. Many
                                    couples are doing this today through mediation rather than going through the
                                    bitterness of a traditional
                                    divorce. The results turn out to be better for everyone involved. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt is a
                                    psychological fact that most people feel that they are right in whatever they do.
                                    But as soon as one
                                    person starts to blame the other, and even worse, demand that the other person admit
                                    to being guilty,
                                    the emotional and legal battles begin. The saddest part of these legal battles is
                                    that they usually end
                                    where they started, with no one having gained very much. <br><br>
                            <li><b>ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY</b>
                                <p> <br>The best way to eliminate anger of all kinds is to accept responsibility. The
                                    acceptance of
                                    responsibility immediately short-circuits the emotion of anger. All the energy that
                                    anger requires for
                                    its existence is cut off. As soon as you say, <i>''I am responsible!''</i> your
                                    anger stops. Because of
                                    the Law of Substitution and the fact that your mind can hold only one thought at a
                                    time, you cannot
                                    accept responsibility for your situation and be angry at the same time.The idea of
                                    blame, on which the
                                    emotion of anger is based, is canceled out by the decision to accept responsibility.

                            <li><b>POSITIVE VERSUS NEGATIVE WORLDVIEWS</b>
                                <p> <br>There are two basic ways of looking at your world.You can have a positive and
                                    <i>benevolent</i>
                                    worldview or a negative and <i>malevolent</i> worldview. By taking responsibility
                                    for yourself and what
                                    happens to you, you become positive. You see the world in benevolent terms.You
                                    become more optimistic
                                    toward yourself and your possibilities. You become a happier and more effective
                                    person. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn contrast, when you take a negative or malevolent worldview, you
                                    see problems and
                                    injustice everywhere.You see oppression and evil. You see guilty people all around
                                    you. You see
                                    limitations and unfairness rather than opportunity and hope. Worst of all, you spend
                                    your time
                                    apportioning blame to various people and institutions for all the problems you see.

                                <p> <br>For example, in this country, some people are better off than others. This has
                                    been true of all
                                    societies throughout human history. This can be for various reasons. It may be the
                                    result of different
                                    people having different talents, ambitions, and desires. It may be the result of
                                    some people working
                                    harder, having a better start at life, being born with greater intelligence, or
                                    simply being at the
                                    right place at the right time to catch a favorable trend in the economy.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIn any case, people who are well off are not to blame for the fat that other
                                    people are not well
                                    off. People who are healthy are not to blame for the fact that other people are
                                    sick. People who are
                                    successful and happy are not to blame for those who are unsuccessful and unhappy.
                                    People who are
                                    building a good life for themselves and their families are not at fault because
                                    other people are not.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccess does not cause failure. <i>Correlation is not

                                    Because both situations occur simultaneously, this does not mean that one caused the
                                    other. An honest
                                    acceptance of this simple fact would solve many arguments and disagreements at the
                                    philosophical and

                            <li><b>THE POWER OF FORGIVENESS</b>
                                <p> <br>The root cause of negative emotions, the main factor that predisposes a person
                                    to blaming and to
                                    anger and resentment, fear and doubt, envy and jealousy, is the <i>inability to
                                        forgive</i> someone we
                                    feel has hurt us in some way. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs we develop as
                                    children, we go through a
                                    phase where ''justice'' is very important to us.We fixate on the concept of
                                    ''fairness.'' We are upset
                                    by any situation in our lives that does not seem to be fair and equitable to anyone,
                                    especially if it
                                    concerns ourselves. Whenever we feel that we or anyone else has been unfairly
                                    treated, for any reason,
                                    we take it as a personal attack. Our fragile selfesteem is threatened.We react with
                                    anger and
                                    resentment. This is a normal developmental phase of growth that we go through as we
                                    move toward
                                    adulthood. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHowever, some people fixate at this stage
                                    and never grow
                                    beyond it. If we are not taught the importance of letting go of our grievances as
                                    children, we will come
                                    into adulthood with a gunnysack of unforgiven experiences. If we are not careful, we
                                    will then build our
                                    lives around our anger toward people who we feel are to blame for something they did
                                    or that we
                                    disapprove of. Many psychotherapists and psychiatrists spend their entire careers
                                    helping people
                                    confront and deal with these unhappy past and current experiences. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                    most powerful and liberating decision you can make is to forgive everyone who has
                                    ever hurt you in any
                                    way. Only by freeing the other person, in your mind, by forgiving him or her can you
                                    be free yourself.
                                    This is why most religions stress the importance of forgiveness as the first step
                                    toward peace of mind
                                    and earthly bliss. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust imagine how you would feel if
                                    you had no anger
                                    toward anyone at all in the whole world. Imagine being a completely positive,
                                    optimistic, cheerful
                                    person, with high levels of self-esteem and enthusiasm and unlimited
                                    self-confidence. Imagine being a
                                    warm, friendly, loving person filled with feelings of calmness and inner peace. All
                                    this is possible for
                                    you when you practice forgiveness. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn contrast, the
                                    refusal or failure to
                                    forgive lies at the base of negativity, anger, stress, anxiety, mental and physical
                                    illness, and most
                                    unhappiness. The refusal to forgive keeps you trapped. Forgiveness sets you free.
                                    And it is always a
                                    choice you make. It has nothing to do with the other person or situation. <br><br>
                            <li><b>IT TAKES TWO</b>
                                <p> <br>Some people hold themselves back from forgiving with a false basic premise.They
                                    think that by
                                    forgiving they are condoning the behavior of the person they are mad at.They think
                                    that, if they forgive
                                    the other person, they are doing that person a favor. They even think that they are
                                    letting the other
                                    person go free, which they are determined not to do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe fact is that it
                                    takes two to make a prison, the prisoner and the jailer. Both are in the jail. When
                                    you let the other
                                    person go free, you liberate yourself.You don't have to condone the behavior or like
                                    the person who hurt
                                    you.You just have to forgive him or her so that you can get on with the rest of your
                                    life. Forgiveness
                                    is therefore a totally selfish act. It really has nothing to do with the other
                                    person at all. It has
                                    only to do with your own mental integrity and peace of mind. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe comedian
                                    Buddy Hackett once said, ''I never hold grudges; while you're holding grudges,
                                    they're out dancing!''
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you remain angry with another person, you give
                                    away your emotional
                                    control to that person each time you think of him or her.You allow him or her to
                                    control your emotions
                                    at long distance. By not forgiving, you allow that person to run your emotional
                                    life, exactly as if he
                                    or she were right there with you and the situation was occurring all over again.

                            <li><b>THE PATH TO FORGIVENESS</b>
                                <p> <br>The way you forgive is simple. Each time you think of the other person, you use
                                    the Law of
                                    Substitution and say, <i>''God bless him/her; I forgive him/her for everything, and
                                        I wish him/her
                                        well.''</i> It is not possible to bless and forgive another person and
                                    simultaneously be angry or
                                    upset. The positive thought cancels out the negative thought. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspYou can
                                    speed up the process of personal liberation by accepting responsibility for your
                                    share of what happened.
                                    Very few negative events that lead to anger and resentment occur in a vacuum. Almost
                                    invariably, you did
                                    something to contribute to the situation. You therefore need to have the maturity to
                                    take your share of
                                    the responsibility. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can then say, <i>''I am
                                        responsible. I shouldn't
                                        have gotten into the situation in the first place, or stayed in so long. I
                                        should not have done what
                                        I did. I forgive him/her completely and let it go.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIt may be
                                    difficult for you to forgive at first.These words will be hard for you. Many people
                                    have built their
                                    entire adult lives around their grievances. They are afraid that they will have
                                    nothing else to talk
                                    about if they stop complaining about their parents or their bad marriages. But don't
                                    worry.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you forgive others and let them go, you soon
                                    begin to feel lighter
                                    and happier. As the thoughts of anger and resentment fade away, your mind will fill
                                    with positive
                                    thoughts.You will have more energy and enthusiasm. You will feel stronger and more
                                    confident.Your whole
                                    future will open up before you, like a summer sunrise. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspDon't worry about
                                    what your friends think or say when you decide to forgive people who have hurt
                                    you.They are probably
                                    tired of hearing your complaints about the unfortunate events of your past. In fact,
                                    when you start
                                    forgiving, you will often find that the only common bond between you and certain
                                    people is your gripe
                                    sessions. When you decide to forgive others, you may no longer find them very
                                    interesting to talk to.

                            <li><b>THE PEOPLE YOU MUST FORGIVE</b>
                                <p> <br>There are four groups people you need to forgive if you are serious about
                                    changing your thinking and
                                    changing your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first is your parents, living
                                    or dead.You must
                                    absolutely forgive them for every mistake they ever made in bringing you up. At the
                                    very least, you
                                    should be grateful to them for giving you life. They got you here. If you are happy
                                    to be alive, you can
                                    forgive them for everything else. Never complain about them again. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany
                                    of my seminar participants have phoned or visited their parents and told them that
                                    they forgive them for
                                    everything. Often this simple act of courage and character has had a profound effect
                                    on their
                                    relationship with their mother or father. From that day onward, they have become
                                    good friends, which
                                    lasted the rest of their lives together. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn contrast,
                                    by not forgiving
                                    your parents, you remain forever a child.You block your own chance to grow up and
                                    become a fully
                                    functioning adult. You continue to see yourself as a victim. Even worse, you keep
                                    your negative feelings
                                    of inferiority and anger alive.If your parents die without your having forgiven
                                    them, it can bother you
                                    for the rest of your life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS</b>
                                <p> <br>The second group you must forgive is the people from your <i>close
                                        relationships</i> that didn't
                                    work out. Marriage and other intimate relationships can be so intense, and so
                                    threatening to your
                                    feelings of self-esteem and self-worth, that you can be angry and unforgiving toward
                                    those people for
                                    years. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut you were at least partially responsible.
                                    Have the personal
                                    strength and integrity to say, ''I am responsible,'' and then forgive the other
                                    person and let him or
                                    her go. Say the words, ''I forgive him/her for everything and I wish him/her well.''
                                    Each time you
                                    repeat this, the negative emotion attached to the memory will diminish. Soon it will
                                    be gone forever.

                            <li><b>THE LETTER</b>
                                <p> <br>Many of my graduates have found that ''the letter'' is the key to putting a bad
                                    relationship behind
                                    them forever. This is a powerful technique that can free you from feelings of anger
                                    and resentment
                                    almost instantly. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is how it works:You to sit
                                    down and write the
                                    other person a letter of forgiveness. It consists of three parts. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst
                                    you say, ''I forgive you for everything you ever did that hurt me.'' <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspSecond, you write out a description or list of every single thing that you are
                                    still angry about.
                                    Some people write several pages in this part. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThird,
                                    you end the letter
                                    with the words, ''I wish you well.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then take
                                    the letter to the
                                    mailbox and drop it in. At that moment, you will feel a huge sense of relief, and
                                    you will be free at
                                    last. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy the way, don't worry about how the other
                                    person might react.
                                    That is not your concern.Your goal is to free yourself, to regain your peace of
                                    mind, and to get on with
                                    the wonderful life that lies ahead of you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>CLEAR YOUR SLATE</b>
                                <p> <br>The third group you must forgive is everyone else in your life who has ever hurt
                                    you in any way. Let
                                    them go. Forgive every boss, business partner, friend, crook, or betrayer who has
                                    ever caused you grief
                                    of any kind. Clean the slate. Wipe each of their names and images off by saying, ''I
                                    forgive him/her for
                                    everything, and I wish him/her well.'' Repeat this statement each time you think of
                                    the person or
                                    situation until the negative feelings are gone. <br>
                            <li><b>SET YOURSELF FREE</b>
                                <p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fourth and final person you have to forgive is
                                    yourself.You must
                                    absolutely forgive yourself for every silly, senseless, wicked, brainless,
                                    thoughtless, or cruel thing
                                    you have ever done or said. Stop carrying these past mistakes around with you. That
                                    was then and this is
                                    now. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThink of it this way:When you did those things
                                    in the past that you
                                    still feel badly about, you were not the person you are today. At that time, you
                                    were a different
                                    person, younger and less experienced. You were not your true self.You were an
                                    immature version of the
                                    person you have become with experience. Stop beating yourself up for something that
                                    occurred in the past
                                    that you cannot change. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn psychotherapy, when a
                                    person feels burdened
                                    with a deep sense of guilt or shame as the result of a childhood trauma, the
                                    cathartic moment comes when
                                    he or she suddenly realizes, ''It's not my fault.'' Sometimes you did things, or
                                    things were done to
                                    you, when you were too young or inexperienced to know what was going on or to change
                                    the situation. It
                                    was not your fault.You did the best you could.You are okay. Forgive yourself and let
                                    yourself off the
                                    hook. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust say, <i>''I forgive myself for every
                                        mistake I ever made. I am
                                        a thoroughly good person and I am going to have a wonderful future.''</i>
                                    Whenever you think of that
                                    event or situation, just repeat, ''I forgive myself completely.'' And then get on
                                    with your life. Focus
                                    on the future rather than the past. Look at where you are going rather than where
                                    you have been.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFinally, if you did something that hurt someone, and
                                    you still feel badly
                                    about it, you can go to that person, or write, and apologize. Tell the person you
                                    are sorry for what you
                                    did or said. Whatever his or her reaction, positive or negative, it doesn't matter.
                                    The very act of
                                    repentance, of expressing regret, will set you free. <br><br>
                            <li><b>A FINAL WARNING</b>
                                <p> <br>Most people are open to the idea of forgiveness. It is among the core beliefs of
                                    most religions, and
                                    is taught in psychology and metaphysics. You are probably comfortable with the idea
                                    of forgiving most of
                                    the people in your life who have hurt you in some way. But there is a great danger.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe danger is that <i>your refusal to forgive just one major grievance
                                        can be enough to
                                        sabotage your entire life.</i> Your insistence on holding onto just one person
                                    or situation by not
                                    forgiving can put the brakes on all your forward progress. There are countless men
                                    and women who ruin
                                    their lives because of their anger and resentment toward a single person.They can't
                                    let go of it, and so
                                    they never get free. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDon't let this happen to you.You
                                    must have the
                                    courage and character to forgive everyone, without exception. There should be no one
                                    in your life with
                                    whom you are still angry. Your mind should be calm and clear.You should be able to
                                    say, <i>''I do not
                                        have a negative or unforgiving thought toward anyone in the world; I freely
                                        forgive them all.''</i>

                            <li><b>TAKE CONTROL OVER YOUR EMOTIONS</b>
                                <p> <br>The starting point of eliminating negative emotions is for you to take full
                                    control over your
                                    thoughts and actions, and to discipline yourself not to express negative emotions
                                    when they arise, as
                                    they surely will.You may not be able to stop the initial negative reaction to a
                                    disappointment or a
                                    frustrated expectation, but you can refuse to express it, either to yourself or to
                                    another.You can
                                    cancel it instantly by saying, <i>''I am responsible!''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThere are
                                    some who say that it is healthy to express the negative emotions of anger, hurt,
                                    fear, and doubt. But
                                    the fact is that <i>whatever you dwell upon and talk about grows in your
                                        reality.</i> A small negative
                                    experience is like a spark that can be fanned into a blaze by thinking and talking
                                    about it. Instead,
                                    snuff it out the instant it arises by saying, ''I am responsible!''Then look for
                                    reasons why you might
                                    be responsible.You will always find them. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>An English poet once wrote, ''When the false gods go, the true gods arrive.''
                                    When you stop thinking
                                    about, talking about, and rehearsing negative events and the emotions they trigger,
                                    the ''true gods'' of

                                    and attitudes that make you unhappy, you will begin to experience the thoughts and

                                    as soon as you stop doing and saying the things that move you away from a sense of
