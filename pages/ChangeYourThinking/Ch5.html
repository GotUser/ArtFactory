                        <li><b>THE GREAT TRUTH</b>
                            <p> <br><i>''You can learn anything you need to learn, to accomplish any goal you can set
                                    for yourself.''</i> This
                                principle offers a way for you to take complete control over your future. When I was
                                young and struggling, failing
                                and frustrated, this principle came along to change my life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspGenerally speaking,
                                <i>no one is smarter than you, and no one is better than you.</i> Just because someone
                                is doing better than you
                                doesn't mean that he is better than you. It usually means that he has just learned how
                                to succeed in his
                                particular field before you have. And whatever someone else has done, you can probably
                                do as well. There are few
                                limits. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is not an easy rule, but it is definitely
                                <i>simple.</i>You, too, can
                                learn anything you need to learn to accomplish any goal you can set for yourself.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspOnce I learned this idea, I was unafraid to change jobs, and even industries. I
                                learned how to sell
                                advertising, investments, automobiles, and office supplies. I worked in real estate
                                sales and leasing, and then
                                real estate development. Then I engaged in importation and distribution, then banking,
                                printing, consulting, and
                                eventually speaking, writing, recording, and corporate training. <br><br>
                        <li><b>LEARN WHAT YOU NEED</b>
                            <p> <br>Every time I entered into a new field, I went out and learned everything I possibly
                                could about that field,
                                and then applied it as fast as I could. At first, I checked out the books from the local
                                library.Then, I bought my
                                own books and built my own library. I listened to every audiocassette I could buy on the
                                subject, and attended
                                every seminar. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I was 31, I studied and prepared
                                myself, and then took the
                                entrance exams to get into a major university. I invested several thousand hours of
                                study to get a business
                                degree. I learned the intricacies of micro- and macroeconomic theory, statistics,
                                probability theory, management
                                science, and accounting. I studied marketing, management, administration, and strategic
                                planning. I became devoted
                                to the concept of learning. <br><br>
                        <li><b>THE GREAT MYSTERY</b>
                            <p> <br>I thought I had come late to the party, that everyone knew that learning was the key
                                to the future. I was
                                amazed and perplexed to find, when I looked around me, that very few other people were
                                doing what I was doing.
                                Most people, by their own admission, were ''living lives of quiet desperation,'' in
                                Thoreau's words. They were
                                working at jobs they didn't like, earning salaries far below their potentials, staying
                                in relationships they
                                didn't enjoy, and living lives that gave them no satisfaction. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspI tried to tell them
                                that the way out was up. I told anyone who would listen that they could learn anything
                                they needed to learn to
                                achieve any goal they could set for themselves.There were no limits. But few people
                                seemed to be listening.

                        <li><b>REASONS FOR EVERYTHING</b>
                            <p> <br>We live in an orderly universe. Everything happens for a reason. When I found that
                                the people around me
                                didn't seem to be interested in changing their situations, I began looking for the
                                reasons underlying their
                                behaviors. And I found them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPsychologists and scholars
                                have spent many years
                                researching the psychology of success and the psychology of failure. And most of the
                                studies conclude that there
                                are two major mental blocks that hold people back. The first is what Dr. Martin Seligman
                                of the University of
                                Pennsylvania, in his book, Learned Optimism (Knopf, 1990), calls ''learned
                                helplessness.'' According to his
                                research, this attitude afflicts fully 80 percent of the population to some degree, and
                                for many people it is
                                their major obstacle to success and fulfillment. <br><br>
                        <li><b>FEELING TRAPPED</b>
                            <p> <br>As the result of childhood experiences, especially destructive criticism and early
                                failure experiences,
                                people eventually reach the point where they feel helpless to change or to take action
                                in different areas of their
                                lives.The majority of men and women feel overwhelmed by things that seem to happen to
                                them, and the many things
                                going on around them. They feel that there is nothing they can do to influence events or
                                to improve their lives.
                                The most obvious proof that an individual is experiencing learned helplessness is the
                                repeated use of the words
                                ''I can't.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPeople feel that they can't lose weight,
                                can't get a better job, can't
                                improve or change their relationships, can't increase their incomes, can't upgrade their
                                knowledge and skills, and
                                can't do many other things that they really want to do. They have tried unsuccessfully
                                so many times in the past
                                that they have come to conclude automatically that there is very little they can do to
                                change the future. They
                                become passive and accepting of their situations. Their lives consist of getting up in
                                the morning, going to work,
                                socializing a bit, coming home, eating dinner, watching television for four or five
                                hours, and then going off to
                                bed. <br><br>
                        <li><b>THE TRAP OF COMPLACENCY</b>
                            <p> <br>The second mental condition that holds people back is called the ''comfort zone.''
                                Human beings are
                                creatures of habit. They begin an activity of any kind and they soon become comfortable
                                with it. They then become
                                extremely reluctant to change what they are doing, or change the situation they are in,
                                even if they are not
                                particularly happy or satisfied with it.They become somewhat content and complacent.
                                Eventually, they become
                                afraid to change, for any reason. They get into a rut, and the longer they stay in their
                                rut, the deeper it grows,
                                until they finally give up all hope of ever changing or improving their lives.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp<i>Learned helplessness,</i> in combination with the <i>comfort zone</i>, creates a
                                person who feels trapped
                                and helpless, weak and powerless, and unable to take control or to make any real
                                difference in his life. The
                                individual in this mental state then strives for security rather than opportunity, and
                                often feels like a victim
                                of circumstances over which he has no control. <br><br>
                        <li><b>NO REAL LIMITS</b>
                            <p> <br>But the reality is that there are no real limits on what you can accomplish with
                                your life. Within reason,
                                whatever someone else has done, you can do as well. The very fact that you can set a
                                clear goal for yourself means
                                that you probably have the ability to achieve it. Nature does not give you a burning
                                desire for something without
                                also equipping you with the talents and abilities you need to acquire it. <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you
                                think back over your life, you will recall that almost everything that you ever really
                                wanted long enough and hard
                                enough you finally achieved.You are not helpless, and you are not stuck in a rut. Your
                                true potential is limited
                                only by your own imagination and determination. <br><br>
                        <li><b>OUR BIGGEST ENEMIES</b>
                            <p> <br>The two factors that contribute most to the feeling of helplessness and the comfort
                                zone are <i>fear</i> and
                                <i>ignorance</i>. Fear is and always has been your greatest enemy. Fear and self-doubt
                                do more to hold you back
                                from dreaming big dreams, and accomplishing great things, than any other factors.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspIt seems that the <i>less you know</i> about a subject, the <i>more fearful</i> you
                                are of trying something
                                new or different in that area.Your ignorance makes you reluctant to reach out for
                                something better than what you
                                are doing today. Fear and ignorance reinforce each other, growing until they induce in
                                you a form of mental
                                paralysis that leads inevitably to underachievement and failure. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspHere is a
                                wonderful discovery. Aggressively learning about any subject builds your confidence and
                                diminishes your fear in
                                that area. As your knowledge or skill increases, you soon reach the point where you are
                                ready to take action and
                                make changes. But if you are completely ignorant in a particular area, if you have not
                                read or learned anything
                                about a subject, it will seem too difficult and may even appear overwhelming to you.
                                Your lack of knowledge will
                                make you afraid to take the actions necessary to improve your life in that area.
                                <br><br>
                        <li><b>NEUTRALIZING YOUR FEARS</b>
                            <p> <br>The antidotes to fear and ignorance are <i>desire</i> and <i>knowledge.</i> The only
                                real limitation on what
                                you can accomplish is the level of intensity of your desire. If you really want
                                something badly enough, there are
                                almost no limits on what you can achieve. And the more you learn about any subject, the
                                greater will be your
                                desire to accomplish something in that area. As your knowledge grows, you become more
                                confident in taking the
                                necessary steps to make your goals a reality. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs you
                                <i>increase</i> your levels of
                                desire and knowledge, you <i>decrease</i> the self-limiting effects of fear and
                                ignorance, and their companions,
                                learned helplessness and the comfort zone. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWith desire
                                and knowledge, you
                                eventually replace fear and ignorance with <i>courage</i> and <i>confidence</i>.The more
                                you learn about anything
                                that is important to you, the more courage you will have to attempt to achieve it, and
                                the more confident you will
                                be that you can eventually succeed. As Henry Ford once said, ''If you believe you can do
                                a thing, or you believe
                                you cannot, in either case, you are probably right.'' <br><br>
                        <li><b>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE</b>
                            <p> <br>My first big breakthrough in life came when I discovered that I could learn anything
                                I needed to learn to
                                achieve any goal I could set for myself. My second breakthrough was when I realized that
                                I was completely
                                responsible for myself and everything that happened to me. <i>No one was going to do
                                    anything for me.</i> If I
                                wanted something, it was completely up to me to do whatever was necessary to get it. If
                                I had a problem or
                                limitation, it was up to me to solve it or overcome it. I was on my own. <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                acceptance of <i>personal responsibility</i> for your life is the giant step from
                                childhood to maturity. Prior to
                                that decision, people criticize, complain, and blame others for their problems. After
                                that decision, they see
                                themselves as the primary creative forces in their own lives. Before you take total
                                responsibility for your life,
                                you see yourself as a <i>victim.</i> Afterward, you see yourself as a <i>victor</i>.

                        <li><b>ALL CAUSATION IS MENTAL</b>
                            <p> <br>My third breakthrough came when I learned that <i>all causation is mental.</i>
                                Everything you create in your
                                material world begins with a thought of some kind. If you want to change something on
                                the outside, you have to
                                begin by changing it first on the inside.You have to change your thinking if you want to
                                change your life. This is
                                the greatest discovery of all. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou create your world with
                                the continuous stream of
                                thoughts, feelings, and images passing through your own mind. You control and determine
                                your future by the
                                thoughts you think in the present. Nothing around you has any meaning except for the
                                meaning you give it by the
                                thoughts and emotions you attach to it. As Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, ''There is
                                nothing either good or bad, but
                                thinking makes it so.'' <br><br>
                        <li><b>THE LAW OF BELIEF</b>
                            <p> <br>Remember, <i>whatever you believe, with feeling, becomes your reality.</i>The
                                greater the intensity of your
                                belief, the more emotion you combine with it, the greater the impact it has on your
                                behavior and on everything
                                that happens to you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you absolutely believe that you
                                are destined to be a great
                                success, and you hold to this belief no matter what happens, then there is nothing in
                                the world that can stop you
                                from becoming that great success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you absolutely
                                believe that you are a good
                                person with tremendous abilities and that you are going to do remarkable things with
                                your life, that belief will
                                express itself through all of your actions and will eventually become your reality. The
                                biggest responsibility you
                                have to yourself is to change your beliefs on the inside so that they are consistent
                                with the realities you wish
                                to enjoy on the outside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can always tell what your
                                beliefs really are by
                                looking at what you do. You always express your true values in your actions. You always
                                act on the outside
                                consistent with who you really are, and what you really believe, on the inside.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne
                                of the best ways to determine your true beliefs is to think about how you behave when
                                you are angry, upset, or
                                under pressure of any kind. This is when they come out. As Terrance wrote,
                                <i>''Circumstances do not make the man;
                                    they only reveal him to himself.''</i> (And to others!) <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspBy using the Law of
                                Reversibility, you can develop within yourself the values, beliefs, and qualities you
                                most admire by acting as if
                                you already had them, whenever they are called for by the circumstances of your life.To
                                develop courage, force
                                yourself to act courageously, even when you are afraid. To develop integrity, speak and
                                act with complete honesty,
                                even if you feel like shading the truth or cutting corners. Soon your beliefs will
                                mirror your acts, and your acts
                                will mirror your beliefs. <br><br>
                        <li><b>THE LAW OF EXPECTATIONS</b>
                            <p> <br>The Law of Expectations says that <i>whatever you expect, with confidence, becomes
                                    your own self-fulfilling
                                    prophecy.</i>You are continually telling your own fortune when you talk about how
                                you think things are going to
                                turn out in a particular area.Your expectations then determine your attitude, and your
                                attitude causes people to
                                behave toward you in a way that reflects what you are thinking inside. <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you
                                expect to be successful, you will eventually be successful. If you expect to be happy
                                and popular, you will be
                                happy and popular. If you expect to be healthy and prosperous, admired and respected by
                                the people around you,
                                that is what will happen. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can tell your true
                                expectations by listening to the
                                words you use to describe an upcoming event. Always think and talk positively about the
                                future. Start every
                                morning by saying; <i>''I believe something wonderful is going to happen to me
                                    today.''</i> Then, throughout the
                                day, expect the best. Be open and alert to the possibility that each thing that happens,
                                positive or negative,
                                contains something good. You will be amazed at the effect this approach to life has on
                                your attitude, and on the
                                way you are treated by the people around you. <br><br>
                        <li><b>POSITIVE SELF-EXPECTANCY</b>
                            <p> <br>Successful, happy people continually maintain an attitude of positive
                                self-expectancy. They expect to be
                                successful in advance, and they are seldom disappointed. They expect to make more sales
                                than they lose.They expect
                                to learn something valuable from every experience. They expect to eventually achieve
                                their goals, and they remain
                                open to the possibility that those goals may be achieved in a way that they didn't
                                expect. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspThe very best way to predict the future is to create it, and you create your
                                future by the way you
                                approach everything that happens to you today, either positively or negatively. If you
                                approach each situation
                                confidently expecting to learn from it or gain from it, you will continue to grow and
                                progress and move toward
                                your goals.You will also be a happier, more optimistic person that other people will
                                want to be around and to

                        <li><b>THE LAW OF ATTRACTION</b>
                            <p> <br>The Law of Attraction is considered by many people to be the most important law of
                                all in explaining both
                                success and failure. This law says that you are a ''living magnet'' and that you
                                inevitably attract the people and
                                circumstances into your life that harmonize with your dominant thoughts, especially
                                those thoughts that you

                                something you want, the more excited you will become about achieving it. The more

                                the more you will attract that goal into your life, like a magnet attracts iron
                                filings.Your thoughts will create
                                a force field of energy that will attract the people, circumstances, ideas,
                                opportunities, and resources that you
                                need to achieve your goals.When you change your thinking about yourself and your
                                possibilities, you will attract
                                into your life the forces necessary to turn those big thoughts and ideas into real-life

                        <li><b>THE LAW OF CORRESPONDENCE</b>
                            <p> <br>This law says that <i>your outer world corresponds to your inner world,</i> that

                                outside is a reflection of your inner world.Whatever you see when you look around you,
                                you see something in
                                yourself. <i>''Wherever you go, there you are.</i>''Your outer world of wealth, work,

                                will mirror back to you the pictures and images that are going on inside you. Nothing
                                can permanently stay in your

                                genuinely, in your heart. As you
                                become a more loving person on the inside, your outer world of relationships will
                                change, and sometimes
                                immediately. To become more financially prosperous on the outside, you must become more
                                prosperous on the inside.
                                To be healthier and fitter in your body, you must think like a healthy and fit person in

                                used consciously and deliberately, are the keys to your accomplishing wonderful things
                                with your life. When you
                                begin to change your thinking about your goals and possibilities, your beliefs and
                                actions will change.You will
                                find yourself doing more and more of the things you need to do to make your dreams come
                                true. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspYou will continually expect good things to happen to you, and you will seldom
                                be disappointed.You will
                                begin attracting all kinds of wonderful people and opportunities into your life. Your
                                whole world will begin to
                                correspond, on the outside, with the wonderful goals and pictures that you are creating
                                on the inside.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful and happy people have a generally positive
                                mental attitude. Prosperous
                                and wealthy people have a prosperous and wealthy mind-set. Kind, patient, gentle, loving
                                people, who enjoy happy
                                and fulfilling relationships with their families and friends, have kind, patient, loving
                                ways of thinking. When
                                you develop the same mind-set that other successful people have, you will soon enjoy the
                                same results and
                                experiences that they do. <br><br>
                        <li><b>START WHERE YOU ARE</b>
                            <p> <br>You may think that you lack the education, opportunities, or resources that other
                                successful people seem to
                                have. Don't worry.The fact is that most people start off with few advantages. The story
                                of most successful people
                                is the story of people who started with nothing and did something worthwhile with their
                                lives. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspI used to feel sorry for myself because I entered my twenties with no money
                                and a limited education.
                                Then I learned that most people start off with little or no money. If they do get a good
                                education, most of it
                                turns out to be largely useless in the real world once they get out of school.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThen
                                I felt sorry for myself because I had no natural talents to help me, and I couldn't find
                                a good job. I soon
                                learned that most people start off in the same boat. Most people try and fail at a lot
                                of things before they find
                                the right situation for their talents and abilities. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                fact is that everything
                                you ever achieve you are going to have to do <i>yourself.</i> No one is going to do it
                                for you. But if you keep
                                learning and growing, trying lots of things, you will eventually get the breaks.
                                Everyone does. Just remember that
                                opportunities are like a fumble in a football game. If you don't personally pick up the
                                ball and run with it, it
                                just lies there and has no effect on the score. When you get your chance, take action on
                                it immediately. <br><br>
                        <li><b>IT'S A WONDERFUL WORLD</b>
                            <p> <br>We are living in a wonderful world today, probably the best period in all of human
                                history.You are
                                surrounded by more opportunities and possibilities to achieve your dreams than have ever
                                existed before. There are
                                no limits to what you can accomplish except for the limits that you put on yourself with
                                your own thinking.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe feeling of learned helplessness and the lure of the
                                comfort zone are the two
                                major mental obstacles to changing your thinking, dreaming big dreams, and setting big
                                goals for yourself.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe way to overcome fear and ignorance is with desire and
                                knowledge. The two
                                qualities that flow out of intense desire and increased knowledge are the courage and
                                the confidence you need to
                                do whatever is necessary to achieve anything you really want. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspYou translate your
                                dreams into concrete realities by turning them into goals.You decide exactly what you
                                want, write it down, set a
                                deadline, and determine the efforts you are going to have to make to achieve it. Make
                                written plans of action to
                                achieve your goal and then do something every day to move toward it. Resolve in advance
                                that you will never, ever
                                give up. <br><br>
                        <li><b>MAKE PROGRESS, NOT EXCUSES</b>
                            <p> <br>Mark Twain once wrote, <i>''There are a thousand excuses for failure, but never a
                                    good reason.''</i>
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I stopped making excuses, I started making progress.
                                When I stopped blaming
                                other people and feeling sorry for myself, I began thinking about specific actions I
                                could take to improve my
                                situation. When I began to set goals and make plans for their accomplishment, I felt in
                                control of my life and my
                                future.When I began learning what I needed to know to achieve my goals, I felt more
                                confident and competent in
                                other parts of my life as well. And as I began achieving my goals, one by one, just as
                                you will achieve yours, my
                                thinking changed completely. <br><br>
                        <li><b>CHANGING YOUR LIFE</b>
                            <p> <br>Success is an inside job. It is a state of mind. It begins within you and is soon
                                reflected in the world
                                around you. When you change your thinking for the better, you become a better person. By
                                dreaming big dreams and
                                envisioning an exciting future, you become a leader. By writing down your goals and
                                making plans to accomplish
                                them, you take full control of your life. And by practicing the ideas taught in this
                                book, you can and will become
                                <i>unstoppable.</i> <br><br><b>ACTION EXERCISES</b>
