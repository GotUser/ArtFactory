                        <p> <b>- Thomas Dreier</b></p>
                        <p> <br><br>The most important principle of human life is that <i>you become what you think
                                about most of the
                                time.</i> This insight is the foundation of religion, philosophy, metaphysics,
                            psychology, and all
                            success. Your outer world is very much a reflection of your inner world. If you change your
                            thinking, you
                            change your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour biggest challenge and your greatest
                            responsibility are
                            to create within yourself the mental equivalent of what you want to experience on the
                            outside. By doing this,
                            you activate all your mental powers, and put the forces of the universe to work on your
                            behalf. You take full
                            control over your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany thousands of people have been
                            asked what they
                            think about most of the time. Over and over, the most successful men and women report the
                            same things.They
                            think about what they want and how to get it most of the time. Unsuccessful and unhappy
                            people, in contrast,
                            think and talk about what they don't want. They think and talk about their problems and
                            worries, and about the
                            people in their lives that they don't like. But this is not for you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbspWhen you
                            think and talk continuously about what you want and how to get it, this way of thinking soon
                            becomes a
                            habit.When you think and talk about what you want, you become more positive, purposeful, and
                            creative. When
                            you stay focused on where you're going, you become a more productive and effective person.

                            <li><b>LEARNED OPTIMISM</b>
                                <p> <br>Perhaps the most important quality you can develop to achieve greater success
                                    and happiness is
                                    the quality of <i>optimism.</i> You can learn the habit of optimism by thinking the
                                    way that
                                    optimists do most of the time. According to interviews with thousands of the
                                    happiest and most
                                    successful people in every field, optimists seem to have two special ways of dealing
                                    with life.
                                    These are attitudes of mind that you can develop with practice. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp
                                    &nbspFirst, optimists <i>look for the good</i> in every situation, especially when
                                    they experience
                                    reversals and setbacks. They keep themselves positive by looking for the bright
                                    side, the silver
                                    lining, to every problem. And they always find something. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspSecond,
                                    optimists <i>seek the valuable lesson</i> in every problem or difficulty. They
                                    believe that each
                                    temporary failure or obstacle has been sent to teach them something. They
                                    continually ask, ''What am
                                    I meant to learn from this situation?'' And they always find something.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspYour mind is structured in such a way that you cannot look for the good and
                                    seek the valuable
                                    lesson without taking full control over your conscious mind.When you do, you feel
                                    more positive and
                                    optimistic about yourself and your situation. You feel in complete control of your
                                    life.You perform
                                    at your best. <br><br>
                            <li><b>SEVEN STEPS TO HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIVING</b>
                                <ol> <br>In addition to looking for the good and seeking the valuable lesson, optimists
                                    have seven
                                    orientations, or generalized ways of thinking about themselves and their lives.
                                    These are the seven
                                    subjects that they think about most of the time. <br>
                                    <li><b>Think about the Futur</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst, positive,
                                        happy people are
                                        <i>future-oriented.</i> They think and talk about the future much of the
                                        time.They think and
                                        talk about where they are going, rather than about what has happened in the
                                        past. They create a
                                        clear, exciting future vision of what is possible for them. By the Law of
                                        Attraction, they find
                                        themselves attracted toward their future hopes and dreams, and their future
                                        hopes and dreams
                                        are attracted toward them. <br>
                                    <li><b>Think about Your Goals</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSecond, they are
                                        <i>goals-oriented</i>.They think and talk about their goals much of the time.
                                        Once they have
                                        dreamed and fantasized about their ideal future visions, they boil them down
                                        into clear,
                                        written goals and plans that they work on every day. They focus their attention
                                        and concentrate
                                        their energies. They use their goals to take control over their futures. <br>
                                    <li><b>Think about Excellence</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThird, they are
                                        <i>excellence-oriented.</i> They commit to becoming excellent at what they do,
                                        to joining the
                                        top 10 percent of people in their field, whatever it is.They identify their key
                                        result areas,
                                        and set standards of excellent performance for themselves in each one. They work
                                        on themselves
                                        each day, and never stop improving. <br>
                                    <li><b>Think about the Solution</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFourth, they are
                                        <i>solution-oriented</i>. They think about the solution rather than the problem.
                                        They think
                                        about what needs to be done rather than who is to blame. They use creative
                                        thinking methods to
                                        unlock their creativity and that of the people around them. They view their
                                        goals as problems
                                        to be solved, and they believe that there is a logical solution to every
                                        difficulty just
                                        waiting to be found. <br>
                                    <li><b>Think about Results</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFifth, successful,
                                        happy people are
                                        intensely <i>results-oriented.</i> They carefully plan each day in advance. They
                                        set clear
                                        priorities on their activities. They then work on those tasks that represent the
                                        most valuable
                                        use of their time.They plow through enormous amounts of work and become known as
                                        highly
                                        productive people. Because they are so effective and efficient, they get more
                                        done, they move
                                        ahead faster, and they make a greater contribution to their work and to their
                                        worlds. <br>
                                    <li><b>Think about Growth</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSixth, high performers
                                        are
                                        growth-oriented. They are continually reading, listening to audio programs, and
                                        attending
                                        additional courses and seminars. They are determined to stay at the cutting edge
                                        of their
                                        fields. They know that the future belongs to the competent, to those few people
                                        who know more
                                        than their competitors. They know that there is a race on, and that they are in
                                        it. They are
                                        determined to win. <br>
                                    <li><b>Think about Action</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSeventh, and perhaps
                                        more important
                                        than any of the others, the most successful people are intensely
                                        action-oriented. They think
                                        about what they can do, right now, to move faster toward their goals. They are
                                        in constant
                                        motion. They work in real time. They have a sense of urgency.They cover more
                                        ground and get a
                                        lot more done than the average person. The more they get done, the better they
                                        get, the more
                                        valuable they become, and the more they earn.<> <br>
