                        <p> <br>The way you think about yourself and your life determines almost everything that happens
                            to you. Your primary
                            responsibility is to take full control over your thinking and to keep your words and
                            thoughts clearly focused on the
                            things that you really want. Simultaneously, you must refuse to think about the things that
                            you don't want. This
                            simple formula is the real key to health, happiness, and personal prosperity. <br><br>&nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis
                            chapter is about ''possibility thinking.'' This is the process of looking at everything that
                            is going on around you
                            in terms of possibilities and opportunities rather than as difficulties or problems. Your
                            goal is to make this a
                            habitual way of thinking, and, like all habits, it is learnable.You can develop it with
                            constant repetition.
                            Eventually, you will become a completely positive and constructive person in everything you
                            do. <br><br>
                            <li><b>POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE</b>
                                <p> <br>A positive mental attitude is closely associated with success in every area of
                                    life. The kind of people we
                                    like the most and want to associate with tend to be people who are generally
                                    cheerful and optimistic about their
                                    work and personal lives. No one wants to spend time with a negative, pessimistic,
                                    complaining person.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspUnfortunately, it is easy to slip into the habit of
                                    criticizing and
                                    complaining.We are bombarded continuously with negative information, from radio,
                                    television, newspapers, and
                                    magazines and in our daily interactions with others. It may not be easy to rise
                                    above the flood of negativity
                                    that engulfs you, but it is absolutely essential to do so if you want to keep your
                                    spirits up and your mind
                                    clear and positive. <br><br>
                            <li><b>RESPOND CONSTRUCTIVELY TO STRESS</b>
                                <p> <br>A positive mental attitude can be defined as a <i>constructive response to
                                        stress.</i> It doesn't mean
                                    that, no matter what happens, you are happy and cheerful all the time. Having a
                                    positive mental attitude instead
                                    requires that you deal with the inevitable problems of your daily life in a more
                                    effective way than the average
                                    person. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspStress is inevitable. Problems are never
                                    ending. Failures and
                                    disappointments happen to everyone, all the time. The only thing over which you have
                                    any control is how you
                                    respond to these stressful events. If you respond in a positive, constructive way,
                                    you will maintain a generally
                                    positive attitude.When your mind is calm and clear, you will be more creative and
                                    alert.You will be more likely
                                    to see more ways to solve your problems, and to keep moving toward accomplishing
                                    your goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspWhen you respond in a negative or angry way to a problem or difficulty,
                                    you trigger a series of
                                    nervous reactions that shut down the most creative parts of your brain. Instead of
                                    going into a ''react and
                                    respond'' way of thinking, you develop a ''fight or flight'' mentality. <br><br>
                            <li><b>FIVE STEPS TO PERSONAL POWER</b>
                                <p> <br>There is a five-step power process that you can use to keep yourself positive
                                    and to achieve your goals
                                    faster. This five-step process brings together several of the very best techniques
                                    ever discovered for permanent
                                    mind change. It contains and illustrates all of the key principles that you need to
                                    know to become a highly
                                    effective, positive ''possibility thinker'' in your own life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe five steps are:
                                    first, to <i>idealize;</i> second, to <i>verbalize;</i> third, to <i>visualize;</i>
                                    fourth, to
                                    <i>emotionalize;</i> and fifth, to <i>realize.</i> Let me explain how they work one
                                    at a time, and then,
                                    altogether. <br><br>
                            <li><b>IMAGINE YOUR PERFECT FUTURE</b>
                                <p> <br>Perhaps the biggest obstacle to creating a wonderful life is ''selflimiting
                                    beliefs.'' Everyone has them,
                                    and some people have so many of them that they are almost paralyzed when it comes to
                                    taking action.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA self-limiting belief is an idea you have that you
                                    are limited in some way, in
                                    terms of time, talent, intelligence, money, ability, or opportunity. As a result of
                                    these beliefs, most of which
                                    are probably not true, you hold yourself back from taking the steps necessary to
                                    create the kind of life you
                                    really desire. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe way you free yourself from these
                                    negative brakes on your
                                    potential is to change your thinking about who you are and what is truly possible
                                    for you.You put aside any
                                    thought of limitation and begin to idealize and imagine the kind of life that you
                                    want to have a week, a month,
                                    a year, and five years from now, as if anything was possible. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIn
                                    <i>idealization,</i> you consider each of the key areas of your life and imagine
                                    what each would look like if
                                    that area of your life were exactly as you would want it to be, in every respect.

                            <li><b>SHOW ME THE MONEY</b>
                                <p> <br>Start with your income. How much do you want to be earning one, two, three, and
                                    five years from today?
                                    Look around you and ask, ''Who else is earning the kind of money I want to earn, and
                                    what are they doing
                                    differently from me?'' If you don't know or you aren't sure, go and ask them. Do
                                    your homework. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat knowledge, skills, and abilities would you have to have to be
                                    able to earn that amount?
                                    What kind of work would you, or could you, be doing to achieve that kind of income?
                                    What position will you have
                                    in your company? How high up will you have to be in your field or profession? If you
                                    are in sales, how much will
                                    you have to be selling, and to whom? <br><br>
                            <li><b>DESIGN YOUR PERFECT LIFE</b>
                                <p> <br>Imagine your perfect lifestyle. If you had no limitations at all, how would you
                                    like to live, day in and
                                    day out? If you were financially independent, what kind of home would you like to
                                    live in? What kind of car
                                    would you want to drive? What kind of life would you like to provide for your
                                    family? What sort of activities
                                    would you like to engage in throughout the week, month, and year? <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHow much time
                                    would you want to take off on vacation, and where would you like to go? What would
                                    you like to do? What sort of
                                    activities do you most enjoy? If you were forced to take a month off from work and
                                    you had all the money you
                                    needed, how would you spend that time? <br><br>
                            <li><b>FAMILY PLANNING</b>
                                <p> <br>Involve your family in your design of an ideal lifestyle. Make this an ongoing
                                    part of your
                                    relationships.The more people get a chance to discuss a course of action, the more
                                    committed they will be to
                                    whatever is finally decided. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSome time ago, a good
                                    friend of mine sat down with
                                    his wife and children to discuss the fact that he was working too much and not
                                    spending enough time with the
                                    family.They imagined how they would spend their time as a family if they had no
                                    limitations. Everyone
                                    contributed ideas, including the young children. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs a
                                    result of this exercise,
                                    they made some decisions about both time and lifestyle. They decided to move out of
                                    the city to a larger home
                                    with a bigger yard in the country. He reorganized his workweek so that he worked
                                    four days per week in the city,
                                    10 to 12 hours per day, and then worked only three or four hours on one day in his
                                    office at home in the
                                    country. He ended up spending much more time with his family and getting far more
                                    satisfaction out of life. The
                                    best part was that both his results and his income actually increased with this new
                                    plan. <br><br>
                            <li><b>TURN YOUR IDEAL INTO REALITY</b>
                                <p> <br>When you sit down and design your ideal lifestyle, you can then compare it to
                                    what you are doing today and
                                    notice the differences. You can then start thinking about how you could bring your
                                    real or current lifestyle
                                    closer to your ideal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you idealize your income

                                <p> <br>You should idealize about your health, as well. Imagine your health was perfect
                                    in every way. How would
                                    you be different from today? Exactly how much do you want to weigh, and what level
                                    of fitness do you want to
                                    enjoy? How does that compare with where you are today? What steps will you have to
                                    take, and what changes will
                                    you have to make in your health habits in order to become the ideal person that you
                                    desire to be personally?
                                    This description then becomes your ideal future vision for yourself. <br><br>

                                    to move to the top of your field? What is your growth plan to get from where you are

                            <li><b>YOUR MISSION STATEMENT</b>
                                <p> <br>When you conduct personal strategic planning for yourself, you always begin with
                                    a <i>mission
                                        statement.</i>This is clear definition of exactly what you want to be and
                                    accomplish at some future date. To
                                    develop your mission statement, you project forward and imagine that you have been
                                    completely successful in
                                    achieving all your goals in a particular area.You then describe your life and
                                    activities in this area exactly as
                                    if they were already true today. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example, your
                                    personal mission statement
                                    could be something like: <i>''I am a happy, healthy, positive person who does
                                        excellent work, is paid extremely
                                        well, is highly respected by his customers and coworkers, and is deeply loved by
                                        his family.''</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis kind of mission statement can then serve as an
                                    organizational blueprint for
                                    your life. You can use it to make decisions by comparing what you are about to do to
                                    see if it is consistent
                                    with your mission. If it is not consistent with your mission, or with your ideal
                                    image of the very best person
                                    you could possible be, you would not do it. <br><br>
                            <li><b>A BENCHMARK FOR DECISION MAKING</b>
                                <p> <br>I conducted a strategic planning session for a large corporation not long ago.
                                    The executives had more
                                    than 250 potential projects on their drawing boards. After we had defined the
                                    values, vision, and ideal mission
                                    of the company, they were immediately able to discard more than 200 of those
                                    potential projects. It was clear to
                                    everyone at the meeting that these projects were not consistent with who they were
                                    as a company and where they
                                    wanted to be in the future. This can work for you as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspOne of your problems
                                    today is that you are overwhelmed with too much to do and too little time. You have
                                    too many things to think
                                    about.You are swamped by too many problems, possibilities, and opportunities. When
                                    you idealize and become
                                    crystal clear about what your perfect life would look like sometime in the future,
                                    you will immediately start to
                                    make better choices in your day-to-day activities.You will immediately begin
                                    eliminating activities that are not
                                    consistent with where you really want to end up. <br><br>
                            <li><b>A KEY TO HAPPINESS</b>
                                <p> <br>A clear definition of your ideal, in any area of your life that is important to
                                    you, is the starting point
                                    of making better decisions in the present that will lead to greater success and
                                    happiness in the future. As you
                                    feel yourself moving toward the achievement of a worthy ideal, you will feel happier
                                    and more confident. The
                                    more progress you make toward a clear goal or set of ideal conditions, the more
                                    energy and enthusiasm you will
                                    have. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE</b>
                                <p> <br>Some years ago, the Gallup organization interviewed 1,500 very successful men
                                    and women in a search for
                                    some of the common denominators of success. But when they asked them to define
                                    ''intelligence,'' they got an
                                    unexpected answer. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe top people in the survey
                                    defined intelligence not so much
                                    as IQ or good grades in school, but more as a <i>way of acting.</i> Intelligent
                                    behavior was defined as doing
                                    only those things that moved them toward their goals. They defined intelligence as
                                    the ability to systematically
                                    eliminate those time-consuming activities that did not help them to achieve their
                                    goals, or even worse, moved
                                    them <i>away</i> from their goals. <br><br>
                            <li><b>GET SMART</b>
                                <p> <br>Whenever you are doing something that is moving you in the direction of your own
                                    self-professed goals and
                                    ideals, you are acting intelligently. This is true irrespective of your education or
                                    your IQ. This is why there
                                    are many people of average intelligence or who did poorly in school who are
                                    accomplishing far more than people
                                    with university degrees. These high achievers focus more and more of their time and
                                    energy on activities aimed
                                    at accomplishing only those goals that are most important to them. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PUT IT IN WORDS</b>
                                <p> <br>The second part of this five-step process is for you to verbalize clearly the
                                    person you want to be, the
                                    things you want to do, and the goals you want to achieve.You verbalize with positive
                                    affirmations. Because you
                                    can completely reprogram your subconscious mind with affirmations, by using them
                                    repeatedly you will find that
                                    your potential is unlimited. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Subconscious
                                    Activity says that whatever
                                    you repeat over and over to yourself in your conscious mind will eventually be
                                    accepted by your subconscious
                                    mind. Once your subconscious mind accepts your conscious thoughts as commands, it
                                    passes them on to your
                                    superconscious mind, which then works 24 hours a day to bring those goals into your
                                    life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspWith positive affirmations, you can take full control over the content of
                                    your conscious and
                                    subconscious minds.You can activate all your mental powers. You can tap into a great
                                    universal mind that can
                                    help you to move more rapidly toward your goals of higher income, better health and
                                    relationships, and greater
                                    success in your field. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE THREE Ps OF POSITIVE PROGRAMMING</b>
                                <p> <br>A positive affirmation is phrased using the ''three Ps.'' This means that for
                                    maximum effectiveness, an
                                    affirmation should be <i>personal, positive,</i> and stated in the <i>present
                                        tense.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspYour subconscious mind is like a special computer. It can be accessed and
                                    activated only with words
                                    and commands that are presented in a specific language. It accepts only positive
                                    commands that are phrased in
                                    the personal, present tense, as though the goal has already been achieved. It knows
                                    no past or future tense.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMy favorite affirmation is, <i>''I like myself!''</i>
                                    repeated over and over
                                    again in a spirit of complete confidence. When you repeat, ''I like myself!''
                                    several times per day, you send
                                    this message deep into your subconscious mind. The more you like yourself, the
                                    higher will be your self-esteem.
                                    The higher your self-esteem, the better you will perform in every area of your life.
                                    The more you like yourself,
                                    the better you will do, and the better you do, the more you will like yourself.
                                    <br><br>
                            <li><b>BECOME YOUR OWN CHEERLEADER</b>
                                <p> <br>To improve your performance in your work, or in any other area requiring skill
                                    or ability, continually
                                    repeat the words, <i>''I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best!''</i> By talking to
                                    yourself as if you were
                                    already the person you want to be sometime in the future, you become your own
                                    cheerleader.You will then find
                                    yourself doing better and better at whatever you attempt. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspAnother powerful
                                    affirmation you can repeat every morning before you start off is, <i>''I love my
                                        work!''</i> Sometimes when you
                                    wake up in the morning, you won't feel particularly excited about the coming day.
                                    But you can take control over
                                    your mind and emotions by repeating, ''I love my work!'' until it actually feels
                                    true. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspEven better, you can start every day with the words, <i>''I like myself and I
                                        love my work!''</i> This
                                    affirmation, repeated enthusiastically several times every morning, will rev you up
                                    and get you excited about
                                    getting to your job. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Fully 95 percent of your emotions are determined by the way you <i>talk</i> to
                                    yourself. Dr. Martin

                                    &nbspYour explanatory style
                                    is defined as how you explain things to yourself. If you explain or interpret things
                                    to yourself in a positive
                                    way, you will be positive. If you explain them in a negative way, you will be
                                    negative.What Seligman concluded
                                    is that optimistic people, when something goes wrong, always explain the event or
                                    experience to themselves as
                                    though it were a temporary, specific situation, rather than a long-term, general
                                    condition. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspImagine that you make a sales call and the prospect is not interested in
                                    what you are selling. It
                                    didn't work out. It was a waste of time. If you are a positive person, you will say
                                    something like, ''Well, it's
                                    just one sales call.'' This makes it temporary. You will say, ''The customer is
                                    probably having a bad day.''
                                    This makes it specific. You then say, ''I'll be more successful on the next call.''
                                    This focuses you on the
                                    future. When you dismiss temporary setbacks in this way, you keep your mind
                                    positive.You remain confident and
                                    optimistic. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DON'T TAKE THINGS PERSONALLY</b>
                                <p> <br>When negative people experience problems, setbacks, or difficulties, they
                                    interpret them differently from
                                    confident, optimistic people. When they fail temporarily, which is inevitable, they
                                    immediately interpret this
                                    as a personal statement about their deficiencies. If the sales call is not
                                    successful, they say, ''I must be a
                                    terrible salesperson. The product is no good. Customers are not interested in what
                                    we have to sell. I'll never
                                    succeed in this field.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn other words, they
                                    overgeneralize and overdramatize a
                                    small failure rather than dismissing it as a temporary setback and going on to the
                                    next call. They interpret the
                                    experience negatively. It then has a negative effect on their self-image: ''I'm no
                                    good.'' Their work
                                    performance declines and they do even worse next time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe good news, however, is
                                    that how you interpret an event is under your control. It is a matter of choice.You
                                    determine how you are going
                                    to feel and react by how you choose to explain a situation to yourself. Choose to
                                    put a positive spin on it,
                                    whatever it is.You are in charge. <br><br>
                            <li><b>MAKE IT SIMPLE</b>
                                <p> <br>When you verbalize your goals in the form of positive affirmations, you should
                                    use words that your
                                    subconscious can easily understand and go to work on. Make your statements simple
                                    and practical. For example,
                                    ''I like myself'' is personal. ''I'm the best'' is personal and positive. And ''I
                                    love my work'' is personal,
                                    positive, and in the present tense. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThese are the
                                    kinds of affirmations that are
                                    immediately accepted by your subconscious mind as commands.They have an immediate
                                    impact on how you think and
                                    feel about yourself. They instantly boost your self-esteem and self-confidence.To
                                    remain optimistic, you must be
                                    continually talking to yourself in terms of the way you want to be rather than the
                                    way things are at the moment.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn neurolinguistic programming, the way that you talk
                                    to yourself about what is
                                    happening to you is called your ''interpretive style.'' The way you interpret things
                                    is a key part of changing
                                    your thinking. The question is always whether you interpret things that are
                                    happening around you in a positive
                                    or negative way. Remember, the optimist sees the glass as half full while the
                                    pessimist sees the glass as half
                                    empty. Choose to be an optimist. <br><br>
                            <li><b>BECOME AN INVERSE PARANOID</b>
                                <p> <br>The multimillionaire W. Clement Stone started off selling newspapers on the
                                    streets of Chicago at the age
                                    of 12. He went on to build Combined Insurance Company of America, and died recently
                                    at the age of 100 worth more
                                    than $800 million. He was a great inspiration to thousands of people, and was famous
                                    for his habit of being an
                                    ''inverse paranoid.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA paranoid is someone who
                                    believes that people are
                                    conspiring against him or her. An inverse paranoid, in contrast, is a person who is
                                    convinced that the world is
                                    conspiring to make him or her successful. An inverse paranoid insists upon
                                    interpreting everything that happens
                                    as part of a great plan leading to success. W. Clement Stone used to respond to
                                    every difficulty with the
                                    emphatic statement, ''That's good!'' Then he would concentrate his attention on
                                    finding out what was good about
                                    the situation. And he always found something, even if it was just a valuable lesson.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIf you change the definition of a problem to a situation, a challenge, or an
                                    opportunity, your response to
                                    the problem will be positive and constructive, rather than negative and angry. If
                                    you look at every problem as a
                                    potential opportunity, you will almost always find within the problem an opportunity
                                    or benefit that you can
                                    take advantage of. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNorman Vincent Peale used to say,
                                    ''When God wants to send you
                                    a gift, He wraps it up in a problem.'' The bigger the problem that you have, the
                                    bigger the gift - in the form
                                    of valuable lessons,ideas, and insights that it probably contains. Is the glass half
                                    full or is it half empty?
                                    It's up to you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOU WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN YOU SEE IT</b>
                                <p> <br>The third part of the five-part process of supercharging your thinking is
                                    visualization.You already know
                                    how powerful this can be in helping you to achieve your goals. It is only when you
                                    learn to use visualization on
                                    every goal and activity that you will truly tap into its amazing power for good in
                                    your life. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs it happens, everyone visualizes, all the time. The difference is
                                    that successful people
                                    visualize the things they want, and unsuccessful people visualize the things they
                                    don't want. Prior to every new
                                    experience, a successful person will take a few moments to recall and relive a
                                    previous successful experience in
                                    that area. Unsuccessful people, in contrast, prior to a new experience will recall
                                    and relive a previous failure
                                    experience. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn each case, people are creating a
                                    predisposition to succeed or
                                    fail. When they visualize, they send a command to their subconscious minds. The
                                    subconscious mind then
                                    coordinates their words and actions in the upcoming situation so that they perform
                                    consistent with that picture.

                                <p> <br>In visualizing, you project your mind forward and create a clear picture of your

                                    imagine what it would look like if it were already achieved.You make your picture as

                                    repeat this mental picture over and over, as often as you possibly can during the
                                    day, and for as long as you
                                    can. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere is a direct relationship between how

                            <li><b>PROGRAM YOUR MIND</b>
                                <p> <br>There are three techniques combining verbalization and visualization that you
                                    can practice to achieve your
                                    goals faster. These are often referred to as ''mental programming techniques.'' They
                                    are amazingly effective in
                                    preparing yourself and your mind for an upcoming event. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe first of these
                                    methods is what is called the <i>quick programming technique.</i> Here is how it
                                    works. Prior to any
                                    nonrecurring event of importance, like a sales call, a meeting, or an interview, you
                                    take a few moments to
                                    prepare mentally, like an athlete would warm up for a competition. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst, take a
                                    few deep breaths. This relaxes you and drops your mind into the alpha state. In this
                                    state, your subconscious
                                    mind becomes highly receptive to any incoming command. Second, you visualize the
                                    ideal outcome of the upcoming
                                    situation.You imagine it as turning out perfectly for you in every respect. For
                                    example, if you are making a
                                    sales call, visualize the client responding to you in a positive, receptive way.
                                    Especially, visualize the
                                    client signing the check or sales order at the end of the conversation.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of my
                                    good friends has used this technique for many years to become one of the
                                    highest-paid people in his industry. He
                                    says it is absolutely amazing how many times the sales situation works out exactly
                                    as he visualized it before he
                                    went in.Try it for yourself and see. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                                    verbalize or create a positive affirmation that is consistent with your mental
                                    picture. A simple affirmation
                                    would be ''This sales call goes extremely well and concludes satisfactorily for
                                    everyone involved.'' This
                                    command instructs your subconscious mind to give you the words, feelings, behaviors,
                                    and body language
                                    consistent with achieving your goal of a successful sales call. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspWe teach this
                                    ''quick affirmation'' technique to applicants who are going on job interviews,
                                    speakers giving public talks,
                                    performers in the arts, and even to politicians. It is an extraordinarily effective
                                    technique, and it only takes
                                    a few seconds prior to each event. <br><br>
                            <li><b>WRITE AND REVIEW YOUR GOALS</b>
                                <p> <br>The second method you can use to bring about rapid internal changes to your
                                    thinking and your life is
                                    called the <i>standard affirmation technique.</i> This technique requires that you
                                    write out your major goals in
                                    the form of present, positive, personal affirmations on three-by-five index cards,
                                    one goal per card.You can
                                    work on 10 to 15 goals at a time using this method. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspCarry these cards around with
                                    you. At the beginning of each day, take a few minutes by yourself to review each
                                    goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspTake the first card and read it. Perhaps the first card says, ''I earn $50,000
                                    per year.'' Read the card
                                    and let your eyes focus on the message so that it is imprinted on your subconscious
                                    mind. Then, close your eyes,
                                    take a deep breath, and repeat the affirmation five times. As you affirm, visualize
                                    your goal as already
                                    achieved. See it. Feel it. Then open your eyes, relax, exhale deeply, and read the
                                    next card. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PREPARE FOR THE DAY</b>
                                <p> <br>This entire exercise, with 10 to 15 goals, takes about 10 minutes. It programs
                                    your subconscious mind at a
                                    deep level, and prepares you to perform at your very best for the rest of the day.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIf you practice this each morning before you start out and each evening before
                                    you go to bed, you will be
                                    absolutely amazed at how quickly your goals begin to materialize. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour
                                    subconscious mind is the sending and receiving station for the power of attraction
                                    in your life. The more you
                                    feed your subconscious mind with words and pictures consistent with what you want to
                                    accomplish, the more you
                                    magnetize your goals.You become a <i>living magnet.</i> You begin to attract people,
                                    opportunities, ideas, and
                                    resources into your life that make achieving your goals a possibility. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PRACTICE MENTAL REHEARSAL</b>
                                <p> <br>The third mental programming technique that you can use to perform better and
                                    achieve your goals faster is
                                    often called mental rehearsal. It is taught and used extensively in sports of all
                                    kinds. The process is both
                                    simple and powerful. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst, you sit or lie down,
                                    completely relaxed, with your
                                    eyes closed, and breath deeply until your whole body is calm and quiet.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSecond,
                                    you clearly visualize an upcoming event, or a goal that you desire. You allow
                                    yourself to enter into the
                                    experience and see it clearly in your mind. You imagine yourself actually doing and
                                    saying the things you would
                                    if the upcoming situation is perfect. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the very
                                    best times to practice
                                    mental rehearsal is just before you go to sleep. By verbalizing and visualizing your
                                    ideal goals or activities
                                    for the coming day immediately prior to sleeping, you program your subconscious mind
                                    to work on those goals all
                                    night long. Then, when you wake up in the morning, you will often have insights and
                                    ideas that you can use to
                                    make those goals a reality. It is an amazing technique and is extremely effective.
                                    <br><br>
                            <li><b>PREPROGRAM FOR PEAK PERFORMANCE</b>
                                <p> <br>You can use this technique to preprogram your mind for a variety of things. For
                                    example, let us say you
                                    have a problem that you are worried about. Just before you go to sleep, turn this
                                    problem over to your
                                    superconscious mind and ask for a solution. Then, forget about it and go to
                                    sleep.Very often, when you wake up
                                    in the morning the solution will occur to you. It will be crystal clear and perfect
                                    in every respect.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can use this method of mental programming to
                                    assure that you wake up feeling
                                    positive and energetic. The process is both simple and effective. Just before going
                                    to sleep, say to yourself,
                                    ''When I wake up in the morning, I feel terrific!'' Repeat this several times.
                                    Imagine yourself getting up the
                                    next morning feeling happy and full of energy. Especially when you go to bed late
                                    and you need to be at your
                                    best the next day, use this technique to wake up feeling refreshed. It works every
                                    time. <br><br>
                            <li><b>WAKE AT A CERTAIN TIME</b>
                                <p> <br>You can use mental rehearsal and preprogramming to wake up at the desired time
                                    without an alarm clock. No
                                    matter where you are, or in what time zone, you can ''set your mind'' on a certain
                                    time before you go to sleep,
                                    and you will wake up at exactly that minute. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBefore
                                    you fall asleep, you say, ''I
                                    wake up tomorrow morning at seven o'clock sharp.'' You can then fall to sleep
                                    without worrying. The next
                                    morning, your heart rate will gradually speed up, waking you at your preset time.You
                                    will be unable to go back
                                    to sleep.You can even travel great distances and wake up in different time zones on
                                    schedule using this method.

                            <li><b>GET THE FEELING OF SUCCESS</b>
                                <p> <br>The fourth element in mental programming is emotionalization.This requires that
                                    you create the feeling
                                    that would go with successful accomplishment of your goal. This is the part that
                                    makes idealizing, verbalizing,
                                    and visualizing really work for you.Your emotions are the energy source, the jet
                                    fuel that drives you toward
                                    your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou have heard it said that humans are 10
                                    percent logical and 90
                                    percent emotional.The fact is, however, that you are initially 100 percent
                                    emotional.You decide emotionally, and
                                    then justify logically. Everything you do is governed and controlled by your
                                    emotions, in some way. The only
                                    question is, ''What emotion is in charge?'' <br><br>
                            <li><b>MASTER OR SLAVE?</b>
                                <p> <br>Many people are slaves to their emotions. With very little control over their
                                    feelings, they continually
                                    react and respond to other people and situations.They have no minds of their own.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspOne of your chief responsibilities to yourself is to get your emotions under
                                    control. Take charge of your
                                    positive emotions rather than allowing yourself to be dominated by your negative
                                    emotions. By using your
                                    emotions deliberately and purposefully, especially by keeping them positive and
                                    focused on what you want, you
                                    can put enormous power behind your visualizations, verbalizations, and
                                    idealizations. <br><br>
                            <li><b>IMAGINE YOUR IDEAL OUTCOME</b>
                                <p> <br>One way to unlock the energy and power contained in your emotional nature is for
                                    you to get the feeling
                                    that you would enjoy if you had already achieved your goal. See it in your mind's
                                    eye and create within you the
                                    emotions you would experience if your dream came true this very minute.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspImagine,
                                    for example, that your goal is to earn a certain amount of money. Project mentally
                                    into the future and see
                                    yourself earning this kind of money. See the larger house, the bigger car, the
                                    better clothes, the nicer
                                    restaurants, and the more elegant lifestyle that you will enjoy when you are earning
                                    this amount of money.
                                    Imagine how you would feel if you were already enjoying all these ingredients of
                                    success. Imagine the feelings
                                    of pride, happiness, satisfaction, pleasure, joy, and gratitude that you would
                                    experience once you achieved this
                                    goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust like a person soaking in a hot bath, soak
                                    your mind in these feelings,
                                    exactly as if you were already at your destination. These emotions will then trigger
                                    thoughts, desires, and
                                    actions consistent with them. Each will reinforce the other. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE COMBINATION IS POWERFUL</b>
                                <p> <br>When you combine all three - a mental picture, a verbalization, and an emotion -
                                    you activate your
                                    subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind then passes this impression on to your
                                    <i>superconscious</i> mind,
                                    which works on your goals 24 hours per day. When you practice combining
                                    verbalization, visualization, and
                                    emotionalization on every goal, you will be absolutely astonished at the things that
                                    begin happening to you, and
                                    the goals that you accomplish. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce you activate your
                                    superconscious mind, you
                                    will receive a continuous stream of insights and ideas that you can use to solve

                                    It will bring you the information that you need, at exactly the right time for you.
                                    It will give you intuitions
                                    and hunches that guide you to make the right decisions. Your superconscious mind
                                    will give you a steady flow of

                                    you activate this process and unleash all your mental powers is by continually
                                    idealizing, verbalizing,
                                    visualizing, and especially emotionalizing. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DREAMS COME TRUE</b>
                                <p> <br>The fifth element in this five-step power process is realization, to actually
                                    achieve your goals and to
                                    have your wishes come true. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is the most
                                    important part of the process. But
                                    you must be aware that every goal takes a certain amount of time to materialize.
                                    Some goals can be achieved
                                    quickly. Some require weeks and even months of patient, steady work. Others are
                                    long-term goals, requiring
                                    several years to bring to fruition.Your attitude toward the time required for goal
                                    attainment has a major impact
                                    on whether and when you accomplish them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn the
                                    realization phase, after you have
                                    practiced the first four steps, you simply relax and let go of the process.You allow
                                    your goal to appear in its
                                    own time. Exactly the things that you want and need will come to you at exactly the
                                    time that you are ready for
                                    them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people eventually develop an
                                    attitude of calm, confident
                                    expectation. They are never rushed or hurried. They are relaxed and confident, and
                                    they absolutely believe that
                                    everything is conspiring to bring them exactly what they want, at exactly the right
                                    time for them. This must be
                                    your attitude as well. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>You can get even greater benefit from this five-step process for achieving your
                                    goals by using special
                                    techniques in response to the things that happen to you each day. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst of all,
                                    no matter what happens, <i>look for the good</i> in every situation. Seek the
                                    valuable lesson. Look for what you
                                    can gain from any temporary setback or obstacle. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspNapoleon Hill studied and
                                    interviewed successful men and women for 25 years. He found that they had one
                                    characteristic in common. Each of
                                    them had developed the habit of continually looking into every difficulty for the
                                    seed of an equal or greater
                                    benefit or advantage.They constantly looked for the silver lining of even their
                                    darkest cloud. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you are looking for something good to come out of every
                                    problem situation, you will
                                    respond to difficulties in a more positive, creative, and constructive way.You will
                                    be more optimistic and
                                    confident. If you think that you are going to benefit from everything that happens
                                    to you, you will develop the
                                    attitude of the possibility thinker. As a result, no matter what happens, you will
                                    almost always find something
                                    good that you can turn to your benefit or advantage. <br><br>
