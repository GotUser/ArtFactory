                            <li><b>GET REAL!</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHow did you react to the preceding three paragraphs? You
                                    probably had two
                                    responses. First, you liked what they said, and your fondest wish was for them to be
                                    true for you.
                                    But your second response was probably one of skepticism and disbelief. Even though
                                    you deeply desire
                                    to live a wonderfully healthy, happy, prosperous life, when you read those words,
                                    your doubts and
                                    fears arose immediately to remind you of reasons why these dreams and goals may not
                                    be possible for
                                    you.Well, join the crowd!<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is exactly how I felt
                                    many years ago.
                                    Even though I wanted to be a big success in life, I was unskilled, uneducated, and
                                    unemployed. I had
                                    no idea what I could do to improve my situation. I felt trapped between big ideas on
                                    the one hand
                                    and limited resources and opportunities on the other. Then I discovered a series of
                                    remarkable
                                    principles that have been responsible for all the great successes and achievements
                                    of the ages, and
                                    my life changed forever.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAfter proving these laws and
                                    principles in my
                                    own life, I began speaking, and training others to apply the same ideas. Since then,
                                    I have given
                                    more than two thousand talks and seminars as long as four days in length, in 24
                                    countries, to a
                                    total of more than two million participants. Most of them were also skeptical when
                                    they first heard
                                    these ideas of optimism and possibility, until they learned what you are going to
                                    learn in the pages
                                    ahead. It changed their lives, as it will change yours.
                            <li><b>THE GREAT PRINCIPLE</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerhaps the most important mental and spiritual principle ever
                                    discovered is
                                    that <b><em>you become what you think about most of the time</em></b>.Your outer
                                    world is very much
                                    a mirror image of your inner world.What is going on <b><em>outside</em></b> of you
                                    is a reflection
                                    of what is going in <b><em>inside</em></b> of you.You can tell the inner condition
                                    of a person by
                                    looking at the outer conditions of his or her life. And it cannot be otherwise.
                            <li><b>THOUGHTS ARE THINGS</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour mind is extraordinarily powerful. Your thoughts control
                                    and determine
                                    almost everything that happens to you. They can raise or lower your heart rate,
                                    improve or interfere
                                    with your digestion, change the chemical composition of your blood, and help you to
                                    sleep or keep
                                    you awake at night.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour thoughts can make you happy
                                    or sad, sometimes
                                    in an instant. They can make you alert and aware, or distracted and depressed. They
                                    can make you
                                    popular or unpopular, confident or insecure, positive or negative. Your thoughts can
                                    make you feel
                                    powerful or powerless, a victim or a victor, a hero or a coward. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp In
                                    your material life, your thoughts can make you a success or a failure, prosperous or
                                    poverty-stricken, respected or ignored. Your thoughts, and the actions that they
                                    trigger, determine
                                    your whole life. And the best news of all is that they are completely under your own
                                    control.<br>
                            <li><b>THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, AND DESIRES</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou are a complex bundle of thoughts, feelings, attitudes,
                                    desires, images,
                                    fears, hopes, doubts, opinions, and ambitions, each of them constantly changing,
                                    sometimes from
                                    second to second. Each of these elements of your personality affects the others,
                                    sometimes in
                                    unpredictable ways.Your entire life is the result of the intertwining and
                                    interconnecting of these
                                    factors.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour thoughts trigger images and pictures,
                                    and the emotions
                                    that go with them. These images and emotions trigger attitudes and actions.Your
                                    actions then have
                                    consequences and results that determine what happens to you.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIf you
                                    think about success and confidence, you will feel strong and competent, and you will
                                    perform better
                                    at whatever you attempt. If you think about making mistakes or being embarrassed,
                                    you will perform
                                    poorly, no matter how good you really are.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPictures
                                    and images, from
                                    your imagination or from the external influences, produce ideas, emotions, and
                                    attitudes that
                                    correspond to them. They then trigger actions that bring about certain results and
                                    outcomes.The
                                    <em>thought</em> of a person or situation can cause you to instantly feel happy or
                                    sad, elated or
                                    angry, loving or lonely.<br>
                            <li><b>ATTITUDES, ACTIONS,AND EMOTIONS</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour attitudes, positive or negative, constructive or
                                    destructive, lead to
                                    corresponding images, emotions, and actions that affect your life and relationships.
                                    Your attitudes,
                                    in turn, are based on your previous experiences and your basic premises about how
                                    things are
                                    supposed to be.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour actions trigger the emotions and
                                    attitudes that
                                    go with them. By the Law of Reversibility, you can actually act your way into
                                    feeling in a manner
                                    consistent with the action. By acting as if you were already happy, positive, and
                                    confident, you
                                    soon begin to feel that way on the inside. And your actions are under your direct
                                    control, whereas
                                    your emotions are not.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn and of themselves, the outer
                                    aspects of your
                                    life are <em>neutral.</em> It is only the <em>meaning</em> that you give to them
                                    that determines
                                    your attitudes, opinions, emotions, and reactions to them. If you change your
                                    thinking about any
                                    part of your life, you will change how you feel and behave in that area. And since
                                    only you can
                                    decide what to think, you have the ability to take complete control over your
                                    life.<br>
                            <li><b>QUESTION YOUR BELIEFS</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Belief says:<em> Whatever you believe, with
                                        conviction, becomes your
                                        reality.</em>You always act in a manner consistent with your deepest and most
                                    intensely held
                                    beliefs, whether they are true or not. And all your beliefs are learned. At one
                                    time, you did not
                                    have them.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour beliefs largely determine your
                                    reality.You do not
                                    believe what you <em>see</em>; you rather <em>see</em> what you already believe. You
                                    can have
                                    life-enhancing beliefs that make you happy and optimistic, or you can have negative
                                    beliefs about
                                    yourself and your potential that act as roadblocks to the realization of everything
                                    that is truly
                                    possible for you.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most harmful beliefs you can
                                    have are your
                                    <em>self-limiting beliefs.</em> These are beliefs about yourself and your potential
                                    that hold you

                                    accepted
                                    without question, often from early childhood. Even if it is completely untrue, if
                                    you
                                    <em>believe</em> yourself to be limited in areas such as achieving wonderful health
                                    and happiness
                                    and earning a lot of money, that will become your truth. As the author Richard Bach
                                    in his book
                                    <em>Illusions</em> wrote, 'Argue for your limitations and sure enough, they're
                                    yours.'<br>
                            <li><b>YOU ARE A LIVING MAGNET</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Attraction says that you are a <em>'living
                                        magnet'</em> and that
                                    <em>you invariably attract into your life the people, ideas, opportunities, and
                                        circumstances in
                                        harmony with your dominant thoughts.</em><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you
                                    think
                                    positive, optimistic, loving, and successful thoughts, you create a <em>force
                                        field</em> of
                                    magnetism that attracts, like iron filings to a magnet, the very things you are
                                    thinking about. This
                                    law explains why it is that you don't have to be concerned where your good is going
                                    to come from. If
                                    you can keep your mind clearly focused on what you want, and refrain from thinking
                                    about what you
                                    <em>don't</em> want, you will <em>attract</em> everything you need to achieve your
                                    goals, exactly
                                    when you are ready. Change your thinking and you change your life.<br>
                            <li><b>THE ONLY REAL MEASURE</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBertrand Russell, the English philosopher, once said, 'The
                                    very best proof that
                                    something can be done is that others have already done it.' In the New Testament,
                                    Jesus taught the
                                    way to measure the truth of any principle: 'By their fruits, ye shall know
                                    them.'<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIn other words, the only question you need to ask about any idea is,
                                    'Does it work?' Does
                                    it bring about the results that you desire? Milton Friedman, the Nobel prizewinning
                                    economist, said,
                                    'The only true measure of a theory or idea is your ability to make accurate
                                    predictions of the
                                    future based on it.'<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe good news is that the ideas
                                    and principles
                                    you are about to learn have been tested and proven in the lives and experiences of
                                    millions of
                                    people. In themselves, like any principles of nature, they are <em>neutral</em>.
                                    Nature plays no
                                    favorites. Nature treats everyone alike. Whatever seed you plant in the ground,
                                    nature will
                                    grow.Whatever <em>thought seeds</em> you plant in your mind, nature will grow as
                                    well. It is
                                    entirely up to you.<br>
                            <li><b>CHOOSE YOUR THOUGHTS</b>
                                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people are those who think more effectively than
                                    unsuccessful
                                    people. They approach their lives, relationships, goals, problems, and experiences
                                    differently from
                                    others. They sow better seeds, and as a result they reap better lives. If you learn
                                    to think and act
                                    like other successful, happy, healthy, and prosperous people, you will soon enjoy
                                    the kind of lives
                                    they do. When you change your thinking, you change your life.
