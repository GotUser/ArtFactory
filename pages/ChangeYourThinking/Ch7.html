                        <p> <br>The people you know, and who know you in a favorable way, will do more to determine your
                            success, happiness,
                            and level of achievement in life than any other single factor. No one achieves anything of
                            consequence by himself or
                            herself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn life, relationships are everything. My friend
                            Charlie Jones says, ''You
                            will be in five years what you are today except for the books you read and the people you
                            meet.'' <br><br>&nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDr. David McClelland, author of The Achieving Society (Van Nostrand, 1961),
                            concluded after 25
                            years of research at Harvard that your choice of a ''reference group'' would have more to do
                            with your success than
                            anything else. McClelland interviewed graduates of the university, as well as those who had
                            attended his intensive
                            seminars on achievement in American life. He tracked these people for many years. Many of
                            them took what they had
                            learned and did wonderful things with it. They built profitable businesses and successful
                            careers. <br><br>&nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHowever, many of the graduates failed to turn the information and ideas
                            they had learned into later
                            success.Why not? When he went back and surveyed them, he found that invariably they had
                            returned to the same group
                            of people they had been associating with before they had taken the advanced courses on
                            achievement. As a result,
                            they went back to the same old ways, the same old habits, the same old customs and manners
                            of living. Because they
                            were immersed in their old reference groups, nothing changed for them. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR REFERENCE GROUP</b>
                                <p> <br>Your reference group is defined as the people you consider yourself to be
                                    similar to. For example, if you
                                    belong to a particular church, the members of that church are part of your reference
                                    group.You consider yourself
                                    to be like them. If you belong to a political party, a bowling league, or a
                                    particular profession, people in
                                    those groups and organizations are parts of your reference group. You identify
                                    strongly with them. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOver time, through a process of absorption, you will adopt their
                                    attitudes, mannerisms, ways of
                                    speaking, levels of aspiration, and even their style of dress. Your reference group
                                    will exert an inordinate
                                    influence on the kind of person you become.You will adjust your goals, behaviors,
                                    and thoughts to be consistent
                                    with what you feel they will approve of.You see this with teenagers all the time.

                            <li><b>MAKE NEW CHOICES</b>
                                <p> <br>All change in your outer world begins with a change in your inner world. Major
                                    changes in your inner world
                                    start happening when you change the people with whom you associate and identify.When
                                    you select a new reference
                                    group, or find yourself in a situation with different people, you unconsciously
                                    begin to change, almost in spite
                                    of yourself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis change process works quite quickly.
                                    In my speaking and travels,
                                    I have worked with countless men and women all over the country and throughout the
                                    world who have taken this
                                    advice to heart. They have deliberately changed their reference groups. They have
                                    begun associating with
                                    different people in different organizations. Very soon, they began to think
                                    differently about themselves, and
                                    their outer worlds begin to change. <br><br>
                            <li><b>AS A MAN THINKETH</b>
                                <p> <br>The Law of Correspondence says that your outer world is a mirror of your inner
                                    world. It says in the
                                    Bible, ''As a man thinketh, so is he.''This means that as you see yourself and think
                                    about yourself in your
                                    conscious mind, your perception of outer world changes and conforms to fit a picture
                                    consistent with it. This is
                                    the central message of this book. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most
                                    influential factors in your thinking
                                    and feeling will almost always be the other people in your life. Successful people
                                    are those who form the habit
                                    of associating with other positive, successoriented people. Unsuccessful people, by
                                    default, end up associating
                                    with people who are not going anywhere with their lives. Both sets of people become
                                    more and more like the
                                    people with whom they most identify. <br><br>
                            <li><b>FORM A NEW REFERENCE GROUP</b>
                                <p> <br>If you really want to change your thinking and your life, make a decision today
                                    to begin associating, in
                                    every area of your life, with other men and women whom you admire, respect, and look
                                    up to. Resolve to associate
                                    with people whom you enjoy and from whom you can learn.Work and socialize only with
                                    the kind of people that you
                                    want your children to be like when they grow up.When you set these kinds of
                                    standards for your interpersonal
                                    relationships, your whole life will begin to improve almost immediately. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DEVELOP YOUR OWN NETWORK</b>
                                <p> <br>Your network is composed of the number of people you know, both directly and
                                    indirectly. These are people
                                    over whom you can exert some influence and who can in turn exert some influence over
                                    you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe most successful people in our society, at every level, are those who
                                    know the greatest number of
                                    other successful people. They organize their lives to meet these successful people
                                    by deliberate design, not by
                                    accident. And so can you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany men and women, over
                                    time, move from one city to
                                    another, or from one field or industry to another. They start off with few contacts,
                                    yet in no time at all, they
                                    become some of the bestknown and most respected people in their new field.Why does
                                    this happen? It is because
                                    they apply the principles of creative networking to their new lives. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey
                                    immediately begin to form new, positive reference groups. They put into action a
                                    plan to develop as many good,
                                    high-quality relationships as possible within the shortest period of time. <br><br>
                            <li><b>BUILDING YOUR NETWORK</b>
                                <p> <br>Here is a great exercise for you. Over the course of the next six months to a
                                    year, make a list in a
                                    notebook of the 100 most important people in your community. As you gather these
                                    names from the newspapers, from
                                    conversations, from news broadcasts, and from your work as you move around, begin to
                                    think of how you could get
                                    to meet and know these people. Remember, the more people you know and who know and
                                    think about you in a positive
                                    way, the more successful you will be in every area of your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspOnce you have
                                    your list of 100 people, you should add to it regularly. Begin to network
                                    systematically with these people. Once
                                    you have a name, think of how you could communicate with that person. The simplest
                                    way of all is to write a
                                    letter expressing your opinion on something that the individual is involved in, or
                                    simply expressing your
                                    congratulations on the person's success for something recently achieved.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBe
                                    patient when you start to expand your circle of contacts. Don't expect the person
                                    you wrote to call you back or
                                    to come in your door to meet with you.You are in the business of sowing seeds.
                                    Sometime down the road, you may
                                    see that the person has done something else and you can write another letter. Over
                                    time, these little efforts
                                    will begin to bear fruit. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PATIENCE PAYS OFF</b>
                                <p> <br>I write letters continually to people that I meet throughout the country. I
                                    always send a copy of a poem,
                                    sometimes a book, sometimes an audio program or something that I feel the other
                                    person would enjoy. I have done
                                    this over the years for hundreds and perhaps thousands of people. Now, wherever I
                                    go, people come up to me and
                                    remind me that I wrote to them and sent them something, often years ago.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA couple
                                    of years ago, I was in Washington, D.C., at a high-level conference, and a senior
                                    person from one of the largest
                                    organizations in the nation's capital came up to me and reminded me that I had
                                    written to him and sent him
                                    something five years before. He still remembered. After this meeting, over time, I
                                    got to know him very well. He
                                    has now introduced me to a variety of other powerful people. These new relationships
                                    have turned out to be very
                                    enjoyable and productive for me. They all started with me sitting down and writing a
                                    friendly letter. <br><br>

                                    want ads or recruitment agencies. Someone has the need for a particular job to be
                                    filled and lets it be known
                                    within a network. The word goes out from person to person, and an individual who
                                    could never be found any other
                                    way often surfaces and is directed, as the result of personal connections, to a job
                                    for which the person is well
                                    suited. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people have found that by broadening
                                    their contacts whenever they
                                    got a chance, they have changed their work lives profoundly. When they did change
                                    careers, they just happened to
                                    know the right person who was in the right place to make the right introduction to
                                    get the right job that saved
                                    the individual years of hard work in reaching that same level of responsibility and
                                    income. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>The major focus of networking developed by most high-achieving men and women and
                                    self-made millionaires is
                                    their regular involvement with groups, clubs, and associations that contain members
                                    who can be of assistance to
                                    them in their particular fields. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn my own
                                    experience, moving from one city to
                                    another, I found that by joining certain clubs and organizations and getting
                                    involved, I was able to develop
                                    more friendships and make more progress in a couple of years than many people had
                                    made in 10 or 20 years.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMake a decision, right now, to join one or two clubs
                                    or associations. The first
                                    association you should join should be the one for your profession or occupation. If
                                    you are in real estate, join
                                    the real estate board. If you are an entrepreneur, join an entrepreneurial
                                    association. If you are in sales,
                                    join a club like Sales and Marketing Executives International. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspWhen you join a
                                    professional association, don't make the mistake of merely attending the meetings
                                    and going home. This is what
                                    80 to 90 percent of the members do. They may get some benefit from their membership
                                    with the organization, but
                                    nowhere near as much benefit as you can get by becoming more involved. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is
                                    your strategy. When you join a club or organization, get the membership book and
                                    look at the various committees.
                                    Ask around and find out which of the committees is the most active and important to
                                    the organization.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSometimes it is the membership committee. Sometimes
                                    it is the government
                                    relations committee. Sometimes it is the education committee or the fund-raising
                                    committee. But whatever it is,
                                    find out what committee seems to have the greatest impact on the health and growth
                                    of the organization, and then
                                    volunteer to serve on that committee. There will almost always be an opening for
                                    someone willing to help.

                                    most of the work. On any
                                    committee, fewer than 20 percent of the people do more than 80 percent of the work
                                    on that committee.Your goal
                                    is to be among that top 10 to 20 percent. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most
                                    important committees attract
                                    the best and most important people in the association. These are the kinds of people
                                    that you want as part of

                                    aside from an occasional
                                    thanks or congratulations, but they are making mental notes, which will serve you in

                                <p> <br>If you have any fears about public speaking, you should make a plan, right now,
                                    to get over them.Your
                                    ability to make a presentation to a small group or to stand up and give a talk or
                                    chair a meeting for a larger
                                    group can do more to bring you to the attention of people who can help you than
                                    almost any other thing you can
                                    do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFortunately, public speaking is a skill you can
                                    learn with practice. I have
                                    urged people over the years to take a Dale Carnegie course or to join Toastmasters
                                    International. They are both
                                    open to everyone and available everywhere. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you
                                    sign up or join one of these
                                    fine organizations, leaders will train you thoroughly in how to speak on your feet.
                                    They will teach you how to
                                    design a talk - with a beginning, a middle, and an end. They will show you how to
                                    speak in a variety of
                                    different situations. And the better you get at speaking, by the Law of Attraction,
                                    the more you will attract
                                    people and opportunities into your life to speak to more and larger groups. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Here's something very important that I learned. The great majority of people,
                                    being selfish, are always
                                    thinking of how they can personally and immediately gain from any interaction that
                                    they have with other people.
                                    But this is not for you. Instead, your job is to look for ways to put in.Your goal
                                    must be to look for ways to
                                    contribute. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis seems to be the strategy used by
                                    many of the top people.Over the
                                    years, I have worked with many wealthy men and women. I will never forget a
                                    billionaire turning to me at the end
                                    of a meeting and privately asking me, ''Is there anything that I can do for you?''
                                    Later, another man, worth
                                    more than $500 million, asked me the same question: ''Is there any way that I can
                                    help you?'' <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I went to work for a man worth over $800 million, in our
                                    second or third meeting, he asked
                                    me if there was anything that he could do in his position to help me in my personal
                                    life. By that simple
                                    gesture, even though I could think of nothing, he earned my lifelong loyalty.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspOver the years, I have observed that many of the most powerful men and women,
                                    at every level of society,
                                    got there by continually looking for ways to help other people. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Here is one of the greatest discoveries of the ages:<i> The more you give of
                                        yourself without expectation
                                        of return, the more that will come to you from the most unexpected sources.</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspMost people think that if they do something good or helpful for a person or
                                    group, their rewards should
                                    come back directly from that person or group. But this is not the way the universe
                                    works. When you do something
                                    nice for someone else, you activate the law of attraction. Because it is a law, you
                                    never have to worry about
                                    your reward. As long as you continue to sow goodness, the universe will take care of
                                    the reaping.Your good will
                                    usually come to you from a completely unexpected source, and at a completely
                                    unexpected time. All you have to do
                                    is be sure that you are continually putting in. The getting out will take care of
                                    itself. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE BEST PEOPLE</b>
                                <p> <br>As a professional speaker, I work with groups and associations all over the
                                    country. Without fail, the
                                    best and most talented people in every association are the ones who attend almost
                                    every meeting. The top people
                                    are the ones who always take the time and make the sacrifice to be there. They are
                                    the ones who always sit on
                                    the committees and volunteer to help in any way possible. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspAnd I have noticed an
                                    interesting phenomenon. Each year, one member of the association will be elected to
                                    be the national president.
                                    As the president, he or she will have to spend as much as half of his or her time
                                    traveling around the country
                                    voluntarily, without pay, on association business. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspYou would think that this
                                    would really cut into the person's ability to make a living. But it seems that
                                    exactly the opposite happens. All
                                    the association presidents I've spoken to found that they made more money, did
                                    better in their careers, and made
                                    more progress in their field in the year that they took off to work for the
                                    association than in any other year
                                    of their work lives. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe more you put in, without
                                    expectation of reward, the more
                                    you get back from the most unexpected sources. And you are in complete control of
                                    what you put in. The universe
                                    will take care of the rest. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Harvey Mackay, in his audio program, How to Build a Network of Power
                                    Relationships, says that the most
                                    important word not in the dictionary (at that time) is the word ''Rolodex.'' He
                                    claims that, if your Rolodex is
                                    big enough, you are never more than two phone calls away from anyone in the country.
                                    Harvey Mackay has a Rolodex
                                    with more than four thousand names that he has gathered over the years. He has found
                                    that at least one of those
                                    people in his Rolodex has direct access to virtually any other person in the country
                                    with whom he wants to
                                    communicate, including the president of the United States. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Napoleon Hill, after decades of studying the richest men in America, concluded
                                    that the formation of a
                                    mastermind network was an important step to great wealth. It was the creation or
                                    joining of a mastermind group
                                    that enabled countless men and women to go from poverty and obscurity to success and
                                    affluence. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe core of your personal network of contacts, even before you
                                    begin to go outside to join
                                    groups and organizations, should therefore be your mastermind network. This is a
                                    small group of four or five
                                    people with whom you meet and talk on a regular basis. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                                    regularly, at least once per week or even more often, with other people who think
                                    like you do is the key to the
                                    success of a mastermind group. Don't worry about being self-serving in these
                                    relationships. Include in your

                                <p> <br>You begin the formation of a mastermind group by approaching one or two people
                                    you like and admire, and
                                    who seem to have the same positive attitude you do. They may be in your field or in
                                    another field. They may be
                                    younger or older than you, of the same gender or not. It doesn't really matter as
                                    long as you have good
                                    chemistry. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most important qualifications are that
                                    they have positive mental
                                    attitudes and are generally optimistic about themselves and their lives. They should
                                    have goals of their own
                                    that they are working on each day. They should be open-minded and curious. They
                                    should believe in personal
                                    development, and already read books, listen to audio programs, and attend courses
                                    and seminars. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>When you get together with members of your mastermind group, you can have an
                                    agenda, or no agenda.Your
                                    meetings can be structured or unstructured.You can talk about general subjects or
                                    specific topics.You may talk
                                    about your own business or about theirs. It doesn't matter. The very activity of
                                    spending time around other
                                    positive people energizes you, makes you more creative, and makes you feel more
                                    enthusiastic toward whatever you
                                    are doing. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn important element of your mastermind
                                    group is the amount of
                                    laughter that you experience together. This is the key measure of the quality of any
                                    of your relationships.
                                    People who laugh a lot together like each other more.They are usually more helpful
                                    and supportive of each other.
                                    The people you enjoy the most in life will always be the people with whom you laugh
                                    and joke the most. <br><br>
                            <li><b>TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER</b>
                                <p> <br>The most important mastermind group that you ever form is with your spouse or
                                    partner. A husband and wife
                                    together, or a couple, can be the most powerful mastermind of all. When two people
                                    are completely attuned to
                                    each other, and completely supportive of each other's hopes and dreams, they form a
                                    powerful combination that
                                    enables each of them to accomplish far more than either could achieve alone.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspPeople who are in an excellent relationship with a person they describe as

                                    the happiest, most successful, and most fulfilled people in our society. Two people
                                    together can create
                                    wonderful things for both of them. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>You can have more than one mastermind network. Some people will have a
                                    mastermind network in their
                                    families. Others will have mastermind alliances with people who participate in the
                                    same hobbies or sports. You
                                    should definitely have a mastermind network that is specifically focused on your
                                    work or career. You can even
                                    have interlocking mastermind groups with people who are involved with you in more
                                    than one area. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe more you interact with other positive people, the more positive
                                    and productive you will be.
                                    Constantly talking with and sharing your ideas and experiences with others will give
                                    you a steady flow of ideas
                                    and insights from their experiences, and help you keep a healthy perspective on what

                            <li><b>GUARD YOUR TIME</b>
                                <p> <br>Your most valuable asset is your time, and relationships with people are
                                    enormously time-consuming. The
                                    number of high-quality relationships you can form and maintain is limited. There are
                                    simply not enough hours in
                                    the day or enough days in the month.You must be selective about the people with whom
                                    you associate. You must
                                    choose them carefully. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBaron de Rothschild, in his
                                    Maxims for Success, said,
                                    ''Make no useless acquaintances.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis may sound a
                                    bit cold, but remember, your
                                    life is precious, and your life is made up of the minutes and hours of each day.You
                                    cannot afford to squander it
                                    on relationships with people whom you cannot help, and who cannot help you, to live
                                    and enjoy a better life. You
                                    must guard your time carefully. As Benjamin Franklin wrote, <i>''Dost thou love
                                        life? Then do not squander time;
                                        for that's the stuff life is made of.''</i> <br><br>
                            <li><b>BE SELECTIVE IN YOUR CHOICES</b>
                                <p> <br>Many highly successful people are often described as ''loners.'' However, this
                                    does not mean
                                    ''a-loners.''They are not isolated, antisocial individuals. They are loners in that
                                    they are highly selective
                                    about who they spend time with. They do not drink coffee with whoever is sitting
                                    there, or go out for lunch with
                                    whoever happens to be walking out the door at the same time. They carefully build
                                    and maintain high-quality
                                    relationships, and they fastidiously avoid negative people who might hold them back.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIf associating with positive people is a key to success, then the flip side is
                                    for you to get away and keep
                                    away from negative or ''toxic'' people. Negative people are the primary source of
                                    most unhappiness. Problems
                                    with such people are most likely your major sources of stress and frustration.
                                    Negative people do more to
                                    diminish your joy in life than any other single factor. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIt's much easier to
                                    bounce back from financial loss or reverses in your career than it is to deal with
                                    negative people in your work
                                    or personal life. One major negative relationship can be enough to cut off all your
                                    chances of achieving your
                                    full potential in your career. Choose your relationships with care. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Most successful people have mentors at different stages of their lives. A person
                                    whom you know and who
                                    knows you and helps you on a regular basis often determines your success in life.

                                    of your life you can benefit from the advice and experience of someone who is
                                    further along the path than
                                    you.The men who have been there to give me guidance and advice as I have grown up
                                    and gone into business at
                                    various levels have affected my life dramatically. This type of relationship can

                                    relationships work. A mentor is like an uncle. He or she is an older friend, someone
                                    wiser and more experienced
                                    than you, who will give you guidance and advice from time to time. A mentor can help
                                    you avoid pitfalls that
                                    might sidetrack your career or hold you back. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>As it happens, the best potential mentors are successful people who are already

                                    of them requires strategy and planning. Here is what you do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp

                                    specific question or need. Most successful people are open to helping other people

                                    first time is with a short
                                    list of key questions for which you need answers to help you to make current
                                    decisions in your life and your
                                    career. Do not approach a mentor asking personal questions about his or her life and
                                    experiences. Busy people
                                    are not interested in sharing their innermost experiences and feelings with someone
                                    they have never met before.

                            <li><b>LOOK FOR COMPATIBILITY</b>
                                <p> <br>In your first meeting, by asking a few specific questions, you are testing the
                                    waters.What you are looking
                                    for is a certain form of chemistry. You are looking for a person you like and
                                    respect and feel comfortable with,
                                    and who likes you and will be willing to help you in the future. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspFor this reason,
                                    you must go slowly at first. You must ask for only a few minutes, and then you must
                                    get on with your business.
                                    You must ask for specific advice about a specific situation. Be respectful,
                                    friendly, and businesslike.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is the key to developing the mentor/mentee
                                    relationship. When you are given
                                    advice, follow it. Don't ask for specific advice and do nothing with it, and then
                                    attempt to come back for even
                                    more advice. This just demonstrates to the prospective mentor that you are wasting
                                    his or her time.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspInstead, if the person suggests that you take a
                                    particular action, do it
                                    immediately. If the mentor suggests that you read a book, get it and read it. If he
                                    suggests that you listen to
                                    an audio program, get it and listen to it. If she suggests that you take a
                                    particular course, sign up for it and
                                    attend. <br><br>
                            <li><b>BE RESPECTFUL OF THEIR TIME</b>
                                <p> <br>Many people contact me and ask me to be a mentor to them, not only from
                                    throughout the United States and
                                    Canada but from foreign countries as well. Aside from the fact that I am extremely
                                    busy, I respectfully decline
                                    all invitations because of the particular approach that they usually take. They call
                                    up or write and want me to
                                    take complete charge of their lives. They want me to spend many hours of my time
                                    guiding, counseling, and
                                    directing them, and helping them in their jobs or careers. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe fact is that a
                                    prospective mentor is usually very busy and cannot even consider the possibility of
                                    spending large blocks of
                                    time with a complete stranger. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHowever, if you go
                                    slowly and you follow the
                                    advice given to you by a mentor, the individual may conclude that investing time in
                                    you is worthwhile. He or she
                                    will be willing to spend even more time with you to help you even further.
                                    Eventually, a very good relationship
                                    can develop. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou may have more than one mentor at the
                                    same time, and you may have
                                    sequential mentors.This means that as one mentor serves his or her purpose in
                                    guiding you, and you evolve and
                                    grow in your career, it will often be time to move on to another mentor who is even
                                    further along than your
                                    first mentor. <br><br>
                            <li><b>RESIST RELATIONSHIP ENTROPY</b>
                                <p> <br>The natural tendency in all relationships is toward entropy. Relationship
                                    entropy means that relationships
                                    run out of energy unless they are continually renewed. People stop doing the things
                                    that they had done earlier
                                    to establish the relationship in the first place. They work very hard to create the
                                    relationship, and then they
                                    take it for granted. They forget to communicate with the other person. They just
                                    assume that everything is going
                                    along fine and that no extra efforts are necessary to maintain the relationship. As
                                    it happens, men are more
                                    likely than women to let this happen. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut all
                                    relationships are a function of the
                                    time invested in them. You can only increase the value of a relationship by
                                    investing more time in it. This
                                    applies to a relationship with your spouse, relationships with your children,
                                    relationships with your staff
                                    members, and especially relationships with your friends and associates on a personal
                                    and professional level.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere is no alternative to personal time invested in
                                    building and maintaining a
                                    relationship.You must be alert to the danger of relationship entropy and be
                                    constantly working to counter it.

                            <li><b>CUSTOMERS FOR LIFE</b>
                                <p> <br>It is quite common in business for someone to work very hard to win a customer
                                    for the first time and to
                                    build the initial relationship. However, once the relationship is established, the
                                    businessperson begins to take
                                    the customer for granted and go off to work on new relationships that are not yet
                                    well established. Then, six
                                    months later, the businessperson is astonished to find that the customer has gone to
                                    a competitor. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs a businessperson, your customer relationships are some of the
                                    most important assets that you
                                    develop and maintain over the course of your career. Once you have invested the time
                                    and energy required to
                                    develop a customer relationship, it is essential that you develop a plan for
                                    relationship maintenance. You make
                                    sure that you are doing whatever is necessary to keep that relationship alive and
                                    growing. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE LAW OF INDIRECT EFFORT</b>
                                <p> <br>There are several principles that apply to building and maintaining
                                    relationships of all kinds. Perhaps
                                    the most important is the Law of Indirect Effort. This law says that <i>you achieve
                                        things with people more
                                        indirectly than directly.</i> Here are some examples of this principle.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you
                                    want to have a friend, the direct way is by trying to get people to like you. This
                                    seldom works. The indirect
                                    way is to be a friend, to treat other people in a friendly way without expecting
                                    anything in return.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you want to impress other people, the direct way
                                    is to tell them about your
                                    accomplishments and show them how clever you are. The indirect way, which is faster
                                    and more effective, is to be
                                    impressed by them. The more you show that you are impressed by someone, the more
                                    they will find you to be an
                                    impressive person. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe indirect way of getting people
                                    to like you is for you to
                                    like them first. The way to get people to admire and respect you is for you to
                                    admire and respect them in
                                    advance. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE LAW OF COMPENSATION</b>
                                <p> <br>The Law of Compensation seems to apply directly to relationships. This law says
                                    that you get out what you
                                    put in, and the more you put in, the more you get out. The more things that you do
                                    for other people, the more
                                    things other people will want to do for you.When you offer to help or serve others,
                                    they will want to help or
                                    serve you. What goes around comes around.Whatever you sow you will eventually reap.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspWe have entered into the era of the ''go-giver'' rather than just the
                                    go-getter. Each person has a deep
                                    desire to reciprocate in his or her relations with others.We want to even things up
                                    when anything nice has been
                                    done for us.We want to pay people back for any kindnesses or favors. We don't want
                                    to feel that we are obligated
                                    to another. Nowhere is this principle more important than in relationships.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere
                                    are many people who think that the key to success is to get around other successful
                                    people and then to exploit
                                    this relationship. This strategy seldom works. It is much better for you to become
                                    the kind of person that other
                                    people want to be around.When you go to work on yourself and become a better person,
                                    better people will want to
                                    associate with you. This is the indirect way. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Sometimes people say they want to marry a rich person. If you want to marry a
                                    rich person, by the law of
                                    indirect effort you had better get busy working on yourself to become the kind of
                                    man or woman that a rich
                                    person would want to marry. You should become very good at what you do, and develop
                                    the manners of an excellent
                                    person. Improvement of your life and prospects on the outside begins with your

                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere have been many studies of social climbers,
                                    people who have joined clubs and
                                    organizations in an attempt to associate with other successful people. Invariably
                                    they fail.Why? Because like
                                    attracts like. People are naturally attracted to people who are at the same level
                                    that they are. If you have not
                                    developed yourself to achieve a certain level of accomplishment in your field, you
                                    cannot take a shortcut and
                                    begin associating with people at that new higher level.They will not be interested
                                    in you, and you will only end
                                    up looking and feeling foolish. <br><br>

                                    relationship-creating individual.You should look for every way possible - in your
                                    personal reference groups, in
                                    your mastermind networks, in your clubs and associations, and with mentors - to form
                                    and maintain high-quality
                                    relationships. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost successful men and women owe
                                    their success to the fact that,
                                    at an earlier time, they made the effort to establish and maintain a particular
                                    relationship that eventually
                                    paid off for them. Doors were opened and opportunities created that saved them years
                                    of hard work. And this can
                                    happen to you as well, if you use creative networking at every stage of your career.
