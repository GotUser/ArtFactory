                                <p> <br>Throughout human history, value has been contained in land, labor, capital,
                                    furniture,
                                    fixtures, machinery, and other hard assets. Wars and revolutions have been fought
                                    over their
                                    control. The primary creators of value were those people who could combine these
                                    various
                                    resources together to produce products and services for the marketplace.

                                    &nbsp &nbspIn the twentieth century, however, we have seen change take place at a
                                    speed that is
                                    virtually unimaginable. In 1900, 50 percent of the American population lived on
                                    farms raising
                                    food for the other 50 percent who lived in towns and cities.Today, less than 3
                                    percent of the
                                    population lives on farms, and they produce not only enough food for all Americans,
                                    but huge
                                    surpluses as well that are exported or even given away to the entire world.

                                    &nbsp &nbspWe have moved from the agricultural age to the industrial age to the

                                    the information age, and we are now entering the communications age. The primary

                                    today is not land, labor, and other hard assets, but knowledge, information, and
                                    ideas.

                                <p> <br>The richest American today, and perhaps the richest person in the world, is Bill
                                    Gates. The
                                    net worth of his company, Microsoft, is greater than the net worth of IBM, which has
                                    been in
                                    business many years longer. Microsoft is based entirely on brainpower. It creates
                                    wealth by
                                    making it easier to process information digitally within computers, and from
                                    computer to
                                    computer by telephone lines, wireless systems, and satellites. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp

                                    building could burn to the ground, but as long as your people got out safely, you
                                    could walk
                                    across the street and start your business again. The chief assets of any
                                    organization, and of
                                    any individual, are contained in the ability to think and to apply that thinking to

                                    results that other people will pay for. The ability to create wealth is determined
                                    by mental
                                    strength rather than physical strength. <br><br>

                                    investment in physical assets can actually be a liability. A change in technology on

                                <p> <br>The primary source of value today is knowledge. Since there is no limit to the
                                    amount of
                                    knowledge you can acquire, there is no limit to the amount of value that you can
                                    create.You can
                                    start from wherever you are, no matter what your background, and begin to increase
                                    your mental
                                    assets. You can start work today on improving your ability to perform and get
                                    results for which
                                    others will pay. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe wonderful thing about knowledge
                                    is that it
                                    can be reproduced hundreds of thousands, even millions of times without losing its
                                    value. It is
                                    the one commodity that can actually be infinite in its application. If you or
                                    someone else comes
                                    up with a new idea to do something faster or better, that idea can be spread around
                                    the world in
                                    no time at all, and be in the hands of millions of other people who can also use it
                                    to improve
                                    their lives and work. And you have lost nothing. The idea still has its original
                                    value to you.
                                    This is absolutely incredible. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Today, our banking and financial industries are struggling to make the shift to
                                    knowledge as
                                    an asset. Banks, for example, will lend money today only against hard assets, things
                                    that can be
                                    seized as collateral and sold to repay the loan. However, the real assets of a
                                    company are not
                                    the tangible items at all. They are the thinking ability of the people who work
                                    there. They are

                                    in your performance. It is not necessary for you to attend university and get years

                                    to bring your knowledge up to the level where it can pay off for you. Sometimes very
                                    small
                                    changes in what you are doing right now, right where you are, can bring about

                                    nose, it earns 10 times the prize money of a horse that comes in second. Does this
                                    mean that the
                                    horse that comes in first is 10 times faster? Is it twice as fast? Ten percent
                                    faster? No, the
                                    horse that wins is only a nose faster. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy the same

                                    possession of one small piece of information at the right time and in the right
                                    place can enable
                                    you to make an extraordinary difference in a particular situation. Often a single

                                    that they conclude that everything they know at the moment is all that there is to
                                    know about a
                                    particular subject.Sometimes they think that what they know is all they need to know
                                    about a
                                    subject as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is called the ''intelligence
                                    trap'' of the
                                    poor performer, the unconscious incompetent. This is a person who does not know, and
                                    does not
                                    know that he does not know. This person cannot be helped, because he is closed to
                                    new
                                    information.This is why the beginning of all wisdom is often the awareness of how
                                    ignorant you
                                    really are, of how little you really know. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>I have traveled in many countries and met countless highly intelligent and
                                    successful people.
                                    I have spoken with many millionaires, multimillionaires, and even billionaires. I
                                    have worked at
                                    the highest level of government with some of the smartest men and women who have
                                    ever lived. And
                                    the one thing that these people seem to have in common is that they never become
                                    impressed by
                                    their own intelligence. In fact, the smarter they get, the humbler they become and
                                    the less they
                                    look upon themselves as experts in any way. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOver 700
                                    years ago,
                                    Roger Bacon of England was considered to be the last universal man. He was thought
                                    to be current
                                    with all the knowledge and science of the day. He, in his day, knew almost
                                    everything there was
                                    to know about everything that was taught academically. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspOf course,
                                    at that time, the amount of available knowledge was limited. There were very few
                                    books. There
                                    were fewer scientists, philosophers, and researchers writing and teaching. <br><br>
                            <li><b>KNOWLEDGE GROWS EXPONENTIALLY</b>
                                <p> <br>Today, however, it is impossible for one person to know everything about even
                                    one small
                                    subject. Just look at modern medicine. There are great minds who spend their entire
                                    lives
                                    studying the workings of the inner ear or the trachea or one of the other organs of
                                    the body.
                                    And even though these highly intelligent and dedicated professionals spend their
                                    whole careers
                                    specializing in a particular part of the body, they never learn everything there is
                                    to know
                                    about even that one organ. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSometimes I ask audiences,
                                    ''Is there
                                    anyone here who is a know-it-all?'' Of course, no one raises his or her hand. Then I
                                    go on to
                                    explain what I mean by a know-it-all. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA know-it-all
                                    is a person
                                    who feels that he knows everything that he needs to know about a subject. How can
                                    you tell if
                                    you have become a know-it-all? It is easy. You have stopped learning and growing in
                                    your area of
                                    specialization.You have stopped reading, listening to audio programs, and taking
                                    additional
                                    courses. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe very fact that you fail to regularly
                                    seek out new
                                    knowledge in your field means that you have unconsciously, accidentally, slipped
                                    into the
                                    intelligence trap of the low performer.You have unwittingly become a know-it-all by
                                    the very act
                                    of not continuing to learn and grow. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>After giving an advanced test to a graduate class of physics students at
                                    Princeton University,
                                    Albert Einstein was on the way back to his office when one of his graduate
                                    assistants asked the
                                    famous professor, ''Dr. Einstein, wasn't that the same exam that you gave to this
                                    physics class
                                    last year?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDr. Einstein nodded and said, ''Yes, it

                                    up his
                                    courage to ask the great Nobel prizewinning physicist, ''But, Dr. Einstein, how
                                    could you give
                                    the same test two years in a row?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp''Because,''
                                    Einstein
                                    replied, ''in the last year, the answers have changed.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIn the
                                    same way, your answers are changing today at a more rapid rate than ever before. The

                                    what is true today may not be true a year from now. The only way that you can be

                                <p> <br>Peter Drucker, in his book <i>Innovation and Entrepreneurship</i> (Harper-
                                    Business, 1985),
                                    writes that the greatest business breakthroughs take place as the result of ''either
                                    the
                                    unexpected success or the unexpected failure.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe
                                    explains that
                                    when something unusual or unexpected happens in any field, the average person
                                    dismisses it as a
                                    random event or as an accident. The superior person, however, studies each

                                    if it were a sign of an underlying trend or an indication of a fundamental change in
                                    the nature
                                    of things. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen an experiment in growing bacteria
                                    failed because
                                    a mold had blown across the laboratory and landed on the petri dish, killing the

                                    lab assistants were about to throw it out. However, a bacteriologist, Alexander
                                    Fleming, became
                                    curious about a mold that was so powerful that it could kill such strong bacteria.
                                    His research
                                    led to the discovery and development of penicillin, which saved millions of lives in

                                    II and won him both a knighthood and the Nobel prize. <br><br>
                            <li><b>KEEP YOUR MIND OPEN</b>
                                <p> <br>In 1975, IBM commissioned consultants to study the market potential of the
                                    personal computer.
                                    They came back with the conclusion that the market for personal computers was only a
                                    few hundred
                                    in the entire world, at best. Based on this information, IBM decided to concentrate
                                    its efforts
                                    on mainframes, where it was already the world leader, and ignore the personal
                                    computer market,
                                    leaving it to a little upstart company in Cupertino, California, called Apple
                                    Computer.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen the Apple computers hit the market and began to
                                    sell by the
                                    hundreds, and then thousands, IBM got smart fast. IBM did an about-face and decided
                                    to plunge
                                    into the small computer business. And the company did. IBM came out with a PC that
                                    within four
                                    years captured more than 50 percent of the world market for smaller computers.

                            <li><b>WATCH FOR THE TRENDS</b>
                                <p> <br>But IBM failed to notice that a major trend to smaller computers had taken
                                    place. Ignoring its
                                    initial success in PCs, IBM continued to concentrate on the development and sale of
                                    mainframes.
                                    While IBM's attention was focused on mainframes, more and more competitors rushed
                                    into the
                                    personal computer field, and eventually IBM was displaced as the world leader.

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIBM failed to see that its success in capturing 50 percent of the

                                    Hewlett-Packard/Compaq, Toshiba, and others. Because IBM missed the trend, it is
                                    unlikely that

                                    transformed
                                    their industry.What could it be for you? <br><br>
                            <li><b>TWO FACTORS THAT HOLD YOU BACK</b>
                                <p> <br>There are two major factors that stand in the way of you using more of your
                                    natural
                                    intelligence. They are <i>psychosclerosis</i> and <i>homeostasis.</i>
                                    Psychosclerosis is another
                                    name for ''hardening of the attitudes.'' This is experienced by a particular type of
                                    person who
                                    is rigid, inflexible, and unchanging. This is the kind of person who develops fixed
                                    attitudes on
                                    a certain person or subject and then resists any attempt to change his mind. This is
                                    often
                                    called the mechanical way of thinking.You probably know people who suffer from it.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe opposite way of thinking is more open and flexible. This is
                                    called the
                                    adaptive worldview. Adaptive people keep their minds open to new information. They
                                    are curious
                                    and interested in new ideas and developments. They are more concerned with what's
                                    right than
                                    with who's right. They are willing to abandon an old idea if someone can come along
                                    and show
                                    them that a new idea has more merit. They are more concerned that the new idea works
                                    to solve a
                                    problem or achieve a goal than they are with being right themselves. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THREE QUALITIES OF GENIUS</b>
                                <p> <br>Geniuses have been studied extensively over the years. One of the most
                                    remarkable conclusions
                                    the experts have arrived at is that geniuses are not necessarily people with
                                    extraordinary high
                                    IQs.They are often ordinary people who use their intelligence in a superior way
                                    compared to
                                    average, or even smarter, people.What this means is that you can function at genius
                                    levels if
                                    you learn to think the way that geniuses do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGeniuses
                                    seem to
                                    have three characteristics in common, each of which you can develop and make into a
                                    regular part
                                    of your thinking. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst, geniuses seem to have
                                    <i>open minds.</i>
                                    They are curious, questioning, flexible, and willing to consider a wide range of
                                    possibilities
                                    in dealing with a question or problem.This adaptive mind-set is like an open door
                                    that allows
                                    ideas to blow through from any direction, or source.This is the mind-set of the
                                    genius. And you
                                    can learn it by practicing it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSecond, geniuses seem
                                    to approach
                                    problems and decisions <i>systematically</i>. They don't throw themselves at a
                                    problem like a
                                    dog chasing a passing car. Instead, they approach every difficult situation by
                                    asking structured
                                    questions in a logical order, like solving a problem in math. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp
                                    &nbspThird, geniuses approach problems with a series of <i>questions.</i> Geniuses
                                    first ask,
                                    <i>''What exactly is the problem?'' and ''Why is this a problem in the first
                                        place?''</i> They
                                    then ask, <i>''What would be an ideal solution to this problem?''</i> and <i>''What
                                        holds us
                                        back from achieving such a solution?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey
                                    ask: <i>Why
                                        does this situation exist? How did it happen? What caused it? Where and when did
                                        it first
                                        occur? Who is involved in it? What are the different ways that we could solve
                                        this
                                        problem? Of all the different ways, which solution seems to be the most
                                        acceptable, all
                                        things considered?</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe very act of
                                    questioning opens
                                    your mind and expands your options. It increases your creativity and stimulates your
                                    imagination. Questioning enables you to think more effectively about the problem,
                                    and ultimately
                                    reach a better decision. <br><br>
                            <li><b>JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS</b>
                                <p> <br>People with <i>mechanical</i> mind-sets tend to jump to conclusions.They see a
                                    problem and
                                    they immediately decide on a solution.When two events happen close together, they
                                    assume that
                                    one event is the reason for the second event. They <i>confuse correlation with
                                        causation.</i>
                                    Once they have made a decision, they look for evidence to confirm what they have
                                    already
                                    decided. Their egos quickly become involved, and they then become reluctant to
                                    change their
                                    minds. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere seems to be a direct relationship
                                    between the
                                    quantity of ideas and approaches you develop to solve a problem and your likelihood
                                    of coming up
                                    with the best idea that will solve the problem in the very best way. For this
                                    reason, you must
                                    discipline yourself to resist the temptation to jump to conclusions, or to rush to
                                    judgment. You
                                    must proceed more slowly, like a genius, and keep asking questions.You must keep
                                    your mind open.

                                <p> <br>If the truth were known, you are an idea-generating organism. Creativity is your
                                    birthright.You are a highly intelligent individual with a continuous flow of good
                                    ideas that you
                                    can use to accomplish goals and improve your life. In fact, even if you have not
                                    used your
                                    creativity for a long time, and most people have not, you can stir it up, like sugar

                                    sources.
                                    Unsuccessful people, in contrast, are those who continue to recirculate the same

                                    tendency of individuals to try to remain consistent with previous opinions and
                                    behaviors. This
                                    form of rigidity blocks off almost all possibilities for growth in the future. To
                                    resist the
                                    tendency toward homeostasis, you should be willing to abandon your old ideas when
                                    someone can
                                    prove that there are newer, better ideas available. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspOne way to
                                    escape the mental trap of homeostasis is for you to be <i>willing to admit that you
                                        are
                                        wrong.</i> The mark of the superior person, in a time of rapid change, is to
                                    always remain
                                    open to the possibility that one's most cherished ideas are incorrect. This takes
                                    tremendous
                                    courage and maturity. But it stimulates more ideas and insights. <br><br>
                            <li><b>WRONG DECISIONS</b>
                                <p> <br>According to the American Management Association, at least 70 percent of your
                                    decisions will
                                    turn out to be wrong in the fullness of time. This 70 percent figure is an average.
                                    Some people
                                    will be wrong even more often. But you can assume, as a rule of thumb, that 7 out of
                                    10
                                    decisions that you make regarding your life and work will turn out to be wrong in
                                    the long run.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is a question for you. If 70 percent of the

                                    managers and executives make turn out to be wrong, how can the world continue to
                                    function? The
                                    answer is simple. Superior people - those who rise to the top of any organization -
                                    are those
                                    who are willing to cut their losses. They are willing to admit quickly that they
                                    have made a
                                    mistake and rectify the situation rather than persisting until it gets worse.

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspUnfortunately, the vast majority of people fall in love with their

                                    decisions, and once having made them, they are reluctant to give them up, even if

                                    evidence is against them. Don't let this happen to you. Instead, resolve to be the

                                    recognize that a decision that you have made or conclusion that you have come to has

                                    invalidated or disproven by new information. Be prepared to drop the old decision
                                    and embrace a

                                <p> <br>One of the great turning points in my life came when, as a young man in my early

                                    discovered the miracle of personal development. My life has never been the same. I
                                    learned that
                                    through personal development you can indeed pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.
                                    I learned
                                    that, by learning what you need to learn to achieve the goals you have set for

                                    dramatically increase the speed at which you learn and retain the new ideas, and

                                <p> <br>Some years ago, I had a good friend who read very little. He was not convinced
                                    that reading
                                    would make any difference to his life or income. He had gotten out of the habit of
                                    reading after
                                    he left school. He argued with me that reading wasn't that important. Meanwhile, he
                                    struggled to
                                    make a living. He was continually frustrated. He was continually losing business to
                                    his
                                    betterinformed competitors. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor almost three years, I
                                    kept at
                                    him, encouraging him to begin daily reading. Finally, he gave in and began to read
                                    each morning,
                                    just for a few minutes. He was amazed at how helpful the reading was, and how much
                                    more
                                    knowledgeable he was when he spoke to his clients. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe
                                    soon began
                                    reading, as I had recommended, an hour per day, one book per week. Within a year,
                                    his income had
                                    doubled. After two years, his income doubled again. Today he is one of the
                                    highest-paid people
                                    in his field. And he is proud to tell me every time I see him that he very seldom
                                    meets a client
                                    who is as well in formed as he is about their business. And the more he reads, the
                                    more
                                    competent and confident he becomes. <br><br>

                                    further or faster than you are doing today except to the degree to which you learn
                                    and practice
                                    something new. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second part of your personal and
                                    professional
                                    development program consists of audio learning programs. If you travel in your work,
                                    you spend
                                    between five hundred and one thousand hours per year in your car. If you turn this
                                    driving time
                                    into learning time, you will get the equivalent of three to six months of 40-hour
                                    weeks of
                                    additional education, just driving from place to place. I have met countless people
                                    who have
                                    doubled, tripled, and quadrupled their incomes by the simple act of listening to
                                    audio learning
                                    programs as they drive around. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>The third key to continuous learning, and to unlocking your mental potential, is
                                    for you to
                                    take all the training you can get. If a training program is offered in the public
                                    arena, it has
                                    already been proven to be highly effective. The person presenting the program has
                                    probably
                                    acquired many years of experience, and may have spent hundreds of hours assembling
                                    the program
                                    that you can take in a half or a full day.You can sometimes save yourself weeks,
                                    months, and
                                    even years of hard work by attending a seminar given by an expert who explains to
                                    you
                                    state-of-the-art ways to get your job done faster and easier. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>When you combine these three: regular reading, regular listening to audio
                                    learning programs,
                                    and regular and continuous training, you have a dynamite combination that can propel
                                    you forward
                                    at a greater speed than you ever could without them. <br><br>
                            <li><b>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</b>
                                <p> <br>As mentioned earlier, Francis Bacon said that knowledge is power. This is only
                                    partially true.
                                    In fact, only knowledge that can be applied to practical purposes for someone else
                                    is actually
                                    power. The libraries are full of knowledge that does no one any good. <br><br>&nbsp
