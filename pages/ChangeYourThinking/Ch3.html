                            <li><b>A JOURNEY THROUGH ITALY</b>
                                <p> <br>Let me tell you a story. Some years ago, I took my family to Italy on
                                    vacation.We toured several of the
                                    great art museums of Rome and Florence. In Florence, there is a special museum that
                                    was built to house the
                                    statue of David created by Michelangelo several hundred years ago. This is perhaps
                                    the most beautiful piece of
                                    sculpture in the world.The actual physical experience of being in the same room with
                                    it is something that none
                                    of us has ever forgotten. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe story of the creation
                                    of the <i>David</i> is very
                                    interesting and contains a lesson for all of us. Michelangelo was commissioned by
                                    the Medicis to create a statue
                                    for the main square in Florence. The Medicis were the wealthiest and most powerful
                                    family of Italy at the time.
                                    A commission for a statue from the Medicis was not only a great honor; it was also a
                                    task that could not be
                                    refused. For two years, Michelangelo searched for a block of stone out of which he
                                    could create the kind of
                                    masterpiece the Medicis were looking for. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFinally, on
                                    a side street of Florence,
                                    partially overgrown with weeds and covered with dirt, he found a huge slab of marble
                                    lying on wooden trestles.
                                    It had been hauled down from the mountains years before and had never been used.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspMichelangelo had walked past this street many times, but this time he stopped
                                    and looked more closely. As
                                    he walked back and forth studying the block of marble, he actually envisioned the
                                    statue of David and saw it in
                                    its entirety. <br><br>
                            <li><b>GREAT SUCCESS REQUIRES LONG, HARD WORK</b>
                                <p> <br>The sculptor quickly arranged to have workmen haul the block of marble to his
                                    studio some distance away.
                                    He then began the long, hard job of hammering and chiseling. It took him two solid
                                    years of work to create the
                                    rough outline of the statue. He then put his hammers and chisels aside and spent two
                                    more years polishing and
                                    sanding before the statue was complete. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMichelangelo
                                    was already famous as a
                                    sculptor, and the news that he was working on a major commission for the Medicis
                                    spread all over Italy. When the
                                    day came for its first public viewing, thousands of people came from all over Italy
                                    and gathered in the main
                                    square.When it was unveiled, the crowd stood gaping in awe. It was breathtakingly
                                    beautiful. People
                                    cheered.Women fainted. The audience was amazed at the incredible beauty of the
                                    enormous statue. Michelangelo was
                                    immediately recognized as the greatest sculptor of his age. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspAfterward, when
                                    Michelangelo was asked how he was able to create such a masterpiece, he replied by
                                    saying that he saw the David
                                    complete and perfect in the marble. All he did was to remove everything that was not
                                    the David. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOU ARE A MASTERPIECE</b>
                                <p> <br>There are many parallels between yourself and the David.You are very much like a
                                    great masterpiece
                                    enclosed in marble as well. But the marble that envelops you, and most other people,
                                    is the marble of small,
                                    limited thinking and excessive worry about the possibilities of loss or failure,
                                    rather than an excited
                                    anticipation of the rewards of success and achievement. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspTo realize your full
                                    potential, your greatest need is to break out of your limited thinking by dreaming
                                    big dreams and imagining
                                    unlimited possibilities.You need to remove all the negative beliefs that hold you
                                    back from becoming all you are
                                    capable of becoming. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut remember, even after the
                                    David had been released from
                                    the marble, it took Michelangelo two solid years of sanding and polishing to turn it
                                    into a masterpiece. In the
                                    same way, you also have to work on yourself, sanding and polishing, learning and
                                    practicing, for days, weeks,
                                    months, and even years, to develop and bring out all the talents and abilities that
                                    lie deep inside of you.

                            <li><b>DREAM BIG DREAMS</b>
                                <p> <br>You begin the process of becoming unstoppable by dreaming big dreams. Since
                                    everything you create in your
                                    world begins with a thought, the bigger the dreams you dream, the bigger the goals
                                    you will achieve. All
                                    successful men and women are dreamers. All peak performers are what are called
                                    ''blue-sky thinkers.'' They
                                    continually allow their minds to float freely when they think about what is possible
                                    for them. They look at the
                                    unlimited blue sky above them as the only limit to everything and anything that they
                                    could possibly be, or have
                                    or do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people continually practice ''back
                                    from the future'' thinking.
                                    They project into the future several years and imagine what their lives would look
                                    like if they had achieved all
                                    of their goals. They look back to the present, from the mental vantage point of the
                                    future, like looking from
                                    the top of a high mountain down to where they are actually standing in the valley,
                                    in the present. They then
                                    look at the path that they would have to take to get to where they want to be in the
                                    future. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspBy the law of correspondence, whatever you can clearly see on the inside,
                                    you will eventually
                                    experience on the outside.You should therefore visualize your goals with as much
                                    clarity and vividness as
                                    possible. Visualize your goals <i>intensely</i> and create within yourself the same
                                    feeling that you would have
                                    if you had already achieved your goals. <i>Visualize</i> your goals frequently.
                                    Replay a picture of your goal,
                                    as if you had already realized it, on the screen of your mind as many times a day as
                                    you possibly can. Visualize
                                    your goals for as long as you possibly can, preferably just before falling asleep
                                    each night. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRepeat these exercises of visualization-vividness, intensity,
                                    frequency, and duration-until
                                    your goals become absolutely clear, living, breathing, exciting, clear pictures in
                                    your mind. The more skilled
                                    you become at moving from the dream through the goal to the visualization, the more
                                    motivated and determined you
                                    will be. The more clarity you develop, the more courage and confidence you will
                                    have, and the more unstoppable
                                    you will become. <br>

                                    time and money you need. Imagine that you have all the connections and contacts, all
                                    the resources and
                                    opportunities, all the education and knowledge, all the skills and experience that
                                    you require to be, have, or
                                    do anything that you could dream of. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspImagine your
                                    ideal lifestyle. Imagine your
                                    ideal job or income. Imagine where you would like to live and how you would like to
                                    spend each day, each week,
                                    each month. Imagine your ideal family life. Imagine your ideal state of health.

                            <li><b>MAKE YOUR OWN DREAM LIST</b>
                                <p> <br>Here is an exercise for you.Take out a piece of paper and at the top write the
                                    words ''Dream List.''
                                    Underline these words and then write down everything that you can think of that you
                                    could ever possibly want if
                                    you had no limitations whatsoever. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost people are
                                    held back by their
                                    self-limiting beliefs.The way you burst these mental chains is with a dream list.The
                                    very fact that you can
                                    write down something that you would love to have someday means that you probably
                                    have within you, right now, the
                                    ability to achieve it. Let your mind float freely as you write. There will be lots
                                    of time to organize and
                                    evaluate your dreams later. <br><br>
                            <li><b>WHAT WOULD YOU DARE TO DREAM?</b>
                                <p> <br>Here is a great question: ''What one great thing would you dare to dream if you
                                    knew you could not fail?''
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you were absolutely guaranteed of success in the
                                    achievement of any one goal,
                                    big or small, long-term or short-term, what would it be? If a billionaire took a
                                    liking to you and offered to
                                    write you a check to cover any goal that you could clearly define, what one goal
                                    would you choose? <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you could have any job, what would it be? If you could work for
                                    any kind of company, what
                                    kind of a company would you select? Where would it be, and what would it be doing?
                                    If your family life and your
                                    relationships could be perfect in every respect, what would they look like? Answer
                                    these questions clearly.
                                    Write them down. <br><br>
                            <li><b>START WORK ON YOUR FUTURE</b>
                                <p> <br>You begin the creation of your ideal future by making up your dream list.You
                                    write down everything that
                                    you would want to be, do and have, exactly as if you had no limitations at all.You
                                    make up your list as if you
                                    were absolutely guaranteed of success. Then you can begin refining your list, step
                                    by step to develop a detailed
                                    blueprint for your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHenry David Thoreau once
                                    wrote, <i>''Have you built your
                                        castles in the air? Good, that's where they should be built. Now, go to work and
                                        build foundations under
                                        them.''</i> Once you have broken free from your limited thinking, like a balloon
                                    casting loose its moorings
                                    and rising high into the sky, you can begin to turn your dreams and fantasies into
                                    concrete practical goals with
                                    specific plans of action. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour ability to set goals
                                    and to make plans for their
                                    accomplishment is the ''master skill'' of success.With this master skill, there are
                                    no limits on what you can
                                    accomplish. Putting your goals on paper is the next step in the process. <br><br>
                            <li><b>HOW TO ACHIEVE ANY GOAL</b>
                                <p> <br>There is a seven-step method for goal setting and achievement that you can use,
                                    over and over, in any
                                    situation, to accomplish anything you could ever want for yourself. These seven
                                    steps constitute a powerful,
                                    proven formula that you can use to change your life immediately. <br><br>
                            <li><b>STEP ONE: DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT</b>
                                <p> <br>A real goal is clear, specific, measurable, and time bounded. A nongoal- a wish
                                    or a hope-is fuzzy and
                                    unclear. It is a fantasy that floats in the air. People with clear, specific goals,
                                    who know exactly what they
                                    want, are very different from people who are going through life hoping for the
                                    best.Your ability to decide
                                    exactly what it is you want in each area of your life is one of the most important
                                    responsibilities of adult
                                    life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPeople often approach me at my seminars and ask
                                    what their goals should be.
                                    I reply that only they can decide. It is amazing how many of them tell me how hard
                                    it is to set goals, and I
                                    agree with them. It is hard, but it is also essential. With clear goals, you can do
                                    almost anything. Without
                                    them, you can do virtually nothing. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the major
                                    reasons that people fail in
                                    life is because they waste so much of their time doing things of low value or no
                                    value at all. And the reason
                                    they waste so much time is because they have no real idea of what they really want.
                                    Once you have clear goals,
                                    your ability to manage your time improves dramatically. <br><br>
                            <li><b>USE YOUR TIME WELL</b>
                                <p> <br>Here is a way to decide whether something is a good use of your time. Just ask,
                                    <i>''Does this move me
                                        toward the achievement of one of my goals?''</i> If the activity helps you to
                                    achieve a goal you have set for
                                    yourself, it is a good use of time. If it doesn't, it is a poor use of time.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen
                                    you get into the habit of only doing those things that move you toward your goals,
                                    your life will take off.Your
                                    results will improve.You will soon find yourself busy every hour of every day doing
                                    things that are helping you
                                    in some way.You will have no time left to spend on activities that aren't helping
                                    you to achieve one of your
                                    goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you set clear goals for yourself, and you
                                    know exactly what you want,
                                    you will become increasingly impatient with activities that are not helping you in
                                    some way.You will watch less
                                    television. You will listen to less radio. You will read the newspapers quickly, if
                                    at all. You will become far
                                    more selective with your friends and your social activities.You will spend time only
                                    with people you enjoy,
                                    people you can learn and benefit from. But, as the old saying goes, <i>''If you
                                        don't know where you're going,
                                        any road will take you there.''</i> <br>
                            <li><b>STEP TWO: WRITE DOWN YOUR GOALS</b>
                                <p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWrite your goals down on paper. There is something
                                    quite incredible that
                                    happens between the brain and the hand. When you take a paper and pen and write down
                                    your goals, you activate
                                    the Laws of Expectation, Attraction, and Correspondence simultaneously. You
                                    intensify your belief and deepen
                                    your conviction that your goals are possible for you. The very act of writing down
                                    your goals gives you a sense
                                    of control and personal power.Written goals increase your resolve and determination
                                    to do whatever is necessary
                                    to achieve them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe speed at which you will begin to
                                    achieve your goals after
                                    you have written them down is nothing short of miraculous. The very act of writing
                                    out your goals increases the
                                    likelihood of your achieving them by as much as 10 times-1,000 percent!
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany
                                    thousands of my graduates have written or come back to tell me about the amazing
                                    things that have happened in
                                    their lives that started immediately after they began putting their goals in
                                    writing. <br><br>
                            <li><b>STEP THREE: BE WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE</b>
                                <p> <br>Determine the price you are going to have to pay to achieve your goal. Make a
                                    list of everything that you
                                    are going to have to do if you want to make your goal a reality. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspAre you going to
                                    have to start each day's work a little earlier, work a little harder, and stay a
                                    little later? Write it down.
                                    Are you going to have to upgrade your knowledge and skills, and take additional
                                    courses? Again, write it down.
                                    Are you going to have to change jobs, change industries, or change careers in order
                                    to achieve everything that
                                    is possible for you? Write it down. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Cause
                                    and Effect is the iron law
                                    of the universe. For everything that you want, there is a price that must be paid.
                                    This price must be paid <i>in
                                        full</i> and <i>in advance</i>. The Law of Sowing and Reaping is not the Law of
                                    Reaping and Sowing.You have to
                                    put in before you <i>get out.</i>You have to <i>give</i> before you
                                    <i>receive</i>.You have to pay the price
                                    before you enjoy the reward. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour willingness to do
                                    whatever you need to do, pay
                                    whatever price is required, go whatever distance is necessary, and make whatever
                                    sacrifice is demanded is the
                                    measure of how badly you really want your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany
                                    people sabotage their own
                                    success by deciding that they want a particular goal, and although they are willing
                                    to pay a high price for it,
                                    they are not quite willing to pay the full price that the goal demands. This is like
                                    wanting to win in a poker
                                    game but not being willing to match the final bet made by the other player.You end
                                    up losing the whole hand,
                                    just as by failing to make a total commitment people end up losing the entire goal.

                            <li><b>STEP FOUR: MAKE A DETAILED PLAN</b>
                                <p> <br>Make a plan, in writing. Remember, the ability to develop written goals and
                                    create plans for their
                                    achievement is the master skill of success. A plan begins with your making a list of
                                    all the things that you can
                                    think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal. Once you have made
                                    your list, you can add new
                                    items as they occur to you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then organize your
                                    list in terms of priority and
                                    sequence. What are the <i>most important </i>things on the list that you will have
                                    to do to achieve your goal?
                                    What are the things that you will have to do <i>before</i> you do something else?
                                    Which items on your list are
                                    dependent on your completing other items <i>first?</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspA plan of action gives you
                                    a track to run on. It increases your level of belief and intensifies your desire for
                                    the goal.You gradually
                                    become convinced that your goal is actually possible and achievable for you.You
                                    begin to see possibilities that
                                    you may not even have been aware of in the absence of a written plan. <br><br>
                            <li><b>STEP FIVE: TAKE ACTION ON YOUR PLAN</b>
                                <p> <br>Take action of some kind in the direction of your goal. Once you have set a
                                    goal, written it down,
                                    determined the price that you are going to have to pay, and made a plan, you must
                                    take some action immediately.
                                    Even if you only make one phone call or collect one piece of information, be sure to
                                    do something. In the Bible
                                    it says, <i>''Faith without deeds is dead.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThere is something powerful in
                                    your willingness to take a specific action, in faith, in the direction of your goal,
                                    with no guarantee of
                                    success.Your action itself seems to trigger all kinds of other powers and forces in
                                    the universe.You activate
                                    the Law of Attraction to help you.When you take action, you demonstrate to yourself,
                                    and to others for that
                                    matter, that you are really serious about your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspUntil you have taken a
                                    specific, irrevocable action of some kind, you have merely engaged in an enjoyable
                                    exercise, like daydreaming.
                                    You have put your key into the ignition but you haven't turned it on. <br><br>
                            <li><b>STEP SIX: DO SOMETHING EVERY DAY</b>
                                <p> <br>Do something every day that moves you toward your most important goal. This is a
                                    vital success principle
                                    that generates energy and enthusiasm. For you to maintain your courage, confidence,
                                    and selfmotivation, you must
                                    be doing something every single day that gives you a feeling of forward motion and
                                    progress.Your job is to build
                                    yourself up to the point where you genuinely feel unstoppable, and the only way that
                                    you can do this is by
                                    refusing to stop, by doing something daily. <br><br>
                            <li><b>STEP SEVEN: NEVER GIVE UP</b>
                                <p> <br>Resolve in advance that you will never quit once you have started toward your
                                    goal. No matter how many
                                    setbacks or obstacles you experience, make the decision that you will keep on
                                    picking yourself up and persisting
                                    until you eventually succeed. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy deciding in advance
                                    that you will persist, no
                                    matter what the difficulty, you give yourself a psychological edge. When the
                                    difficulties do arise, you will be
                                    mentally prepared to plow through them rather than quitting.Your willingness and
                                    ability to persist are what
                                    will eventually guarantee your success. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>If money is your goal, remember that most of the people who are wealthy today
                                    started out with no money at
                                    all, or even deeply in debt. Almost everyone who is on the top today was once at the
                                    bottom. Almost everyone who
                                    is at the front of the line of life was once at the back of the line. Almost
                                    everyone who is wealthy today was
                                    once poor. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost of the five million millionaires in
                                    the United States are
                                    self-made. That is, they started out with nothing and worked their way up. Our world
                                    today has more than 300
                                    self-made billionaires and multibillionaires as well. Many of these are people who
                                    started with little or
                                    nothing, and by changing their thinking, they unleashed their own inner potentials
                                    to achieve extraordinary
                                    financial results. And almost anything that anyone else has done, within reason, you
                                    can do as well.What are
                                    your goals? <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE POWER OF COMMITMENT</b>
                                <p> <br>One of my favorite quotations is from the mountain climber Charles Murray.
                                <p> <i>Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always
                                        ineffectiveness. Concerning all
                                        acts of initiative and creation, there is an elementary truth, the ignorance of
                                        which kills countless ideas
                                        and splendid plans; that the moment that one definitely commits oneself, then
                                        providence moves too.</i></p>
                                <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<i>All sorts of things occur to help one that would never
                                        otherwise have occurred.A
                                        whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all
                                        manner of unforeseen incidences
                                        and meetings and material assistance that no man could have dreamed would have
                                        come his way.</i></p>
                                <p> <br><br>He finishes off his statement with these words from Goethe:
                                <p> <i>Are you in earnest? Seek this very minute, Whatever you can do, or dream you can,
                                        begin it. Boldness has
                                        genius, power, and magic in it. Only engage and the mind grows heated. Begin and
                                        then the task will be
                                        completed.</i></p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>ACTION EXERCISES</b>
