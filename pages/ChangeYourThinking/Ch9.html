                        <p> <b><i>The potential of the average person is like a huge ocean unsailed, a new continent
                                    unexplored, a world of
                                    possibilities waiting to be released and channeled toward some great good.</i></b>
                        </p>
                        <p> <b>- Brian Tracy</b></p>
                        <p> <br>Every change in your life will come about as the result of your mind colliding with a
                            new idea. Ideas are
                            the keys to the future. Ideas contain the answers to all of your problems and the ways to
                            achieve all of your
                            goals.Your need is to become an idea generator, so that you are continually coming up with
                            new and better
                            ideas to deal with the continuous changes and opportunities taking place around you.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspFortunately, you are naturally creative. It is an innate quality. You are born with it.
                            But creativity is
                            subject to the Law of Use, which says, <i>''If you don't use it, you lose it,''</i> at least
                            temporarily. The
                            good news is that you can reignite your creativity by practicing the specific methods and
                            techniques discussed
                            in this book. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PROJECT FORWARD AND THINK BACKWARD</b>
                                <p> <br>Changing your thinking requires that you expand your ideas and imagination about
                                    the person you
                                    could be, the things you could do, and the things that you could have. Every person
                                    who accomplishes
                                    anything worthwhile in life begins with a big dream or a vision of what is possible
                                    for him or
                                    her.They rise above their current surroundings, their existing limitations and
                                    problems, and instead
                                    they imagine themselves sometime in the future living the kind of life they would
                                    like to live.You
                                    need to practice this way of thinking as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspEarlier, we talked
                                    about your <i>ideal future vision.</i>You create this by projecting forward five
                                    years and imagining
                                    that all of your dreams have come true. What would your life look like if it were
                                    ideal in every
                                    way? Where would you be? Who would be there with you? What would you be doing? How
                                    much would you be
                                    earning? And so on. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then return to the present
                                    day and your
                                    current situation. You think of specific steps you could take to capitalize on your
                                    opportunities
                                    and to overcome your limitations and obstacles. This is the primary use of creative
                                    thinking. It is
                                    to solve your problems and trigger mental breakthroughs that you can use to move
                                    faster toward
                                    achieving the goals that are most important to you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THREE MINDS IN ONE</b>
                                <p> <br>You think and operate your life with three different minds. The first is your
                                    <i>conscious</i>
                                    mind.You use your conscious mind to take in new information, compare it with your
                                    current knowledge,
                                    analyze it in terms of its value or relevance to you, and then decide to act or not
                                    to act. This is
                                    the mind with which you direct your life. This is often referred to as the
                                    <i>objective</i> mind.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second mind you use is your <i>subconscious.</i>
                                    Your
                                    subconscious mind is a huge data bank that records every thought, idea, emotion, or
                                    experience that
                                    you ever have throughout your life.This is called the <i>subjective</i> mind. Its
                                    role is to keep
                                    all of your words and actions consistent with your self-concept and with your
                                    current attitudes,
                                    beliefs, fears, and prejudices. Your subconscious mind does not reason; it only
                                    obeys your commands.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour subconscious mind is also responsible for the
                                    operation of all
                                    of your bodily functions. It controls your autonomic nervous system and your heart
                                    rate, breathing,
                                    digestion, basic memory, and so on. It is like a huge computer, so powerful and
                                    precise that it can
                                    process a hundred million commands per second. It maintains a precise balance of
                                    hundreds of
                                    chemicals in each one of your billions of cells, 24 hours a day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspYour
                                    third mind is your <i>superconscious</i> mind. This mind is your direct connection
                                    with infinite
                                    intelligence. It contains all knowledge, and can bring you all the ideas and answers
                                    you will ever
                                    need to achieve any goal that you can set for yourself. This mind is the source of
                                    all inspiration,
                                    imagination, intuition, and hunches. It operates 24 hours a day, and will bring you
                                    exactly the
                                    right answer to your problem or question, exactly when you are ready for it. It is
                                    stimulated by
                                    clear goals, vivid mental pictures, and clear, positive commands in the form of
                                    affirmations.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you use all three minds in harmony, with each
                                    mind performing
                                    the functions for which it was designed, you will accomplish more of your goals,
                                    faster than you
                                    have ever imagined. The proper utilization of your three minds is central to your
                                    changing your
                                    thinking and changing your life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THREE TRIGGERS TO CREATIVITY</b>
                                <p> <br>There are three main factors that trigger creativity.You can use each of them
                                    regularly, in
                                    everything you do. They are: first, <i>intensely desired goals;</i> second,
                                    <i>pressing
                                        problems;</i> and third, <i>focused questions</i>. When you use them all, you
                                    begin to generate
                                    ideas at a rate that will amaze you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy using these
                                    three methods of
                                    mental stimulation - goals, problems and questions - you activate all three of your
                                    minds
                                    simultaneously and you begin to function at much higher levels than the average
                                    person. <br><br>
                            <li><b>INTENSELY DESIRED GOALS</b>
                                <p> <br>The first factor is a clearly defined, <i>intensely desired goal.</i> You must
                                    know exactly what
                                    you want, set a deadline, make it measurable, and develop a plan for its achievement
                                    that you work
                                    on every day.There is a direct relationship between how clear you are about your
                                    desired goal and
                                    how many ideas you will come up with to achieve it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspOne of the most
                                    powerful ways to harmonize the activities of your three minds, and to activate your
                                    creative powers,
                                    is for you to rewrite your goals in the present tense each morning. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspGet a spiral notebook. Each morning, after your daily reading, take a few
                                    minutes and rewrite
                                    your major goals in the present tense, exactly as if they already existed. Take a
                                    few seconds after
                                    rewriting each goal to visualize it as though it were already accomplished. See each
                                    goal in your
                                    mind as if it already existed. Then, smile, relax, and let go. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThis
                                    method of rewriting your goals each morning, visualizing them as if they had already
                                    been achieved,
                                    and them letting them go with complete confidence is a vital part of creating the
                                    mental equivalent
                                    of the things you want. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy using this method, you
                                    will help your
                                    goals to materialize exactly when you are ready for them. By writing and rewriting
                                    your goals, you
                                    burn them deeper and deeper into your subconscious mind. At a certain point, you
                                    activate your
                                    superconscious mind. At that point, you begin attracting into your life people and
                                    circumstances
                                    that can help you to achieve them. <br><br>
                            <li><b>GET THE FEELING</b>
                                <p> <br>Emotion is the key. The more intensely you desire a goal, the more rapidly it
                                    materializes.
                                    Combining your idea of your goal with the intense emotion of desire or excitement is
                                    like stepping
                                    on the accelerator of your mental potential.Your mind will speed up and generate
                                    ideas for goal
                                    accomplishment. The more positive, excited, and enthusiastic you are about achieving
                                    anything, the
                                    more rapidly your mind goes to work to bring it into your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThink
                                    about how you would feel if you had achieved your goal. Would you feel proud, happy,
                                    relieved,
                                    joyous, or exhilarated? Whatever the emotion would be, you should confidently and
                                    happily imagine

                                <p> <br>The second factor that triggers your creativity and activates your positive mind
                                    is <i>pressing
                                        problems</i>. It is only when you are experiencing the pressure of problems and
                                    obstacles that
                                    you are motivated to perform at your mental best. Facing and solving the inevitable
                                    problems and

                                    you.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost people do not understand the nature of problems.
                                    Problems are a
                                    normal and necessary part of life.They are inevitable and unavoidable. Problems come
                                    in spite of
                                    your best efforts to avoid them. Problems, therefore, come unbidden. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe only part of a problem over which you have any control is your response to
                                    your problems.
                                    Effective people respond positively and constructively to problems. In this way,
                                    they demonstrate
                                    that they have developed high levels of ''response-ability.'' They have developed
                                    the ability to
                                    respond effectively when unexpected or undesired difficulties occur. <br><br>&nbsp

                                    &nbspProblems of all kinds bring out your very best qualities. They make you strong
                                    and resourceful.
                                    The more pressing your problems, and the more emotion you invest in solving those
                                    problems, the more
                                    creative you will become. Each time you solve a problem constructively, you become
                                    smarter and more
                                    effective. As a result, you prepare yourself for even bigger and more important
                                    problems to solve.

                                <p> <br>One way to improve your ability to solve problems, and to trigger your
                                    creativity, is for you to
                                    think on paper.Take a few moments to ask, <i>''What exactly is the problem?''</i>
                                    Then write the
                                    answer down in such a form that it describes the problem exactly. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou
                                    can then ask, <i>''What else is the problem?''</i> You should beware of any problem
                                    for which there
                                    is only one definition. The worst thing you can do is to solve the wrong problem.
                                    The more different
                                    ways that you can state a problem, the more amenable it becomes to a solution.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspWhatever difficulties, obstacles, challenges, or factors that are
                                    hindering you or
                                    holding you back in any way, define them clearly in writing. As they say in
                                    medicine, <i>''Accurate
                                        diagnosis is half the cure.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSometimes, when
                                    you begin to
                                    define a problem, you will find that it is actually a ''cluster problem.'' That is,
                                    it is a single
                                    large problem surrounded by several smaller problems. Most problems you deal with
                                    will be composed
                                    of several smaller problems. Often in a difficult situation, there is one large
                                    problem that must be
                                    solved before any of the smaller problems can be solved. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe best
                                    approach to this type of situation is for you to determine the main problem and then
                                    define the
                                    individual parts of the problem separately.You identify the core problem that must
                                    first be solved
                                    and then deal with the smaller problems in order. Sometimes solving one part of the
                                    problem leads to
                                    the resolution of the entire situation. <br><br>

                                    why success has been defined as <i>the ability to solve problems.</i> If you are not

                                    kind of money that you would like, that is an unsolved problem. If you are not

                                    of health and fitness that you desire, this is just a problem that you must solve.

                                    stands between you and your goal is merely a problem waiting for a solution. Any

                                    holding you back is just another problem waiting for you to solve. <br><br>&nbsp

                                    are questions
                                    that you can ask when considering any potential product or service for any market.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first question is, <i>''Is there a market?''</i> Are there
                                    people who can and
                                    will buy this product or service in competition with other products and services
                                    currently being
                                    offered? Many people start businesses without realizing how hard it is to attract a
                                    customer away
                                    from another supplier if the customer is currently happy with the other vendor.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIf the company's answer is, <i>''Yes, there is definitely a market for
                                        what we sell.
                                        There are people who want it and are willing to buy it from us,''</i> my next
                                    question is then,
                                    ''Is the market large enough?'' Many a product or service is good, valuable, and
                                    worthwhile, but
                                    there is not a large enough market to justify investing all the time and energy
                                    necessary to bring
                                    it to the market. There are better and more profitable uses for the money. <br><br>
                            <li><b>WHY COMPANIES FAIL</b>
                                <p> <br>Many people go broke, especially in entrepreneurial ventures, because the market
                                    is simply not
                                    large enough for them to sell enough to justify the trouble and expense of producing
                                    the product or
                                    service in the first place. Every investment must be compared with other possible
                                    investments that
                                    are available at the same time.There may be better places to put your time and
                                    money. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis principle applies to you personally, as well.Your job is to
                                    invest yourself so
                                    that you are getting the highest ''return on energy.'' There are a thousand
                                    different ways that you
                                    can spend your time and your life.You yourself are your most valuable resource, and
                                    you must always
                                    invest this resource where you can get the highest return. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe third
                                    question I ask my clients is, <i>''If there is a market, and the market is large
                                        enough, is the
                                        market concentrated enough so that you can advertise and sell to it in a
                                        cost-effective
                                        way?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis final question is what often
                                    sinks a new product
                                    idea.Yes, there is a market, and yes, the market is large enough, but the market is
                                    spread over such
                                    a wide geographical area that it is virtually impossible to sell to it effectively.

                            <li><b>CONSIDER THE CONSTRAINTS</b>
                                <p> <br>A good way to trigger creative solutions to your problems is to apply the
                                    ''theory of
                                    constraints.''This theory says that, in every process or series of activities, there
                                    is a
                                    <i>limiting factor</i>. There are constraints or bottlenecks that determine the
                                    speed at which you
                                    get from where you are to where you want to go.The very act of identifying the
                                    critical constraints
                                    in your environment often triggers ideas and insights that help you to alleviate
                                    them. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example, let us say that your goal is to double your income
                                    over the next three
                                    to five years. You begin identifying the constraints on achieving this goal by
                                    asking, <i>''Why
                                        isn't my income twice as high already?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBe
                                    honest. Ask
                                    yourself the brutal questions:Why aren't you already earning twice as much as you
                                    are earning today?
                                    What is holding you back? Of all the things that are holding you back, what is the
                                    major limiting
                                    factor that will determine how fast you achieve your goal? <br><br>
                            <li><b>APPLY THE 80/20 RULE</b>
                                <p> <br>The 80/20 Rule seems to apply to constraints, but in a special way. In this
                                    context, this rule
                                    says that 80 percent of the constraints that are holding you back from achieving
                                    your goal are
                                    <i>inside</i> yourself. They are contained within you, rather than in your
                                    environment.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnly 20 percent of the factors that are holding you
                                    back are in the
                                    <i>outside</i> world. This discovery is a shock to most people.The vast majority of
                                    people think
                                    that their major problems are created or caused by situations and people around
                                    them. But this is
                                    usually untrue. Most of the reasons why you are not moving ahead have to do with
                                    your own lack of
                                    skills, ability, or good personal qualities. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DOUBLE YOUR INCOME</b>
                                <p> <br>Let us say that you are in sales.You want to double your income in the next
                                    three to five years,
                                    if not sooner.The first critical constraint you will identify is the amount of your
                                    product or
                                    service that you have to sell. If you could resolve this problem, you would achieve
                                    your goal.n
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce you have identified this main constraint, you
                                    then ask, ''What
                                    is the constraint behind that?''Your next constraint could be the number of
                                    prospects that you have
                                    to find. If you could speak to enough prospects, you could probably double your
                                    sales and double
                                    your income. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then look behind that constraint and
                                    ask what is the
                                    constraint that is causing this limitation. This actual constraint may be your
                                    ability to prospect,
                                    something that is inside of you rather than in the marketplace. <br><br>
                            <li><b>LOOK AROUND YOU</b>
                                <p> <br>One good way for you to determine whether the constraint is internal or external
                                    is to look
                                    around you and see if anyone else is accomplishing the same goals that you want to
                                    accomplish. Is
                                    anyone else already earning twice as much as you are earning selling the same
                                    product or service in
                                    the same market? If someone is already doing it, then the constraint is
                                    <i>internal</i>, not
                                    external. It is something inside you. It is the lack of a particular ability or
                                    attribute that you
                                    need to overcome. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt has been said, <i>''When a man's
                                        fight begins
                                        with himself, he is really worth something.''</i> The superior person always
                                    asks the question,
                                    <i>''What is it in me that is holding me back?''</i> Superior people always look to
                                    themselves
                                    first. It may very well be that there is something in your outside world that is
                                    acting as the brake
                                    on your potential, but the place to start looking is inside. The odds are you'll
                                    find it there.

                                    skillfully, to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. In business, this is your

                                    success. This can be
                                    fatal if one of your goals is to achieve financial independence. Fortunately, you

                                    do we respect
                                    women's intuition so much? It is because women themselves listen to and trust their
                                    intuition more
                                    than men do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFortunately, your intuitive intelligence
                                    is inborn and
                                    can be increased with use. The more you listen to and trust your intuition, the
                                    sharper and more
                                    accurate it becomes. As you use your intuition more, you will receive more and
                                    better answers from
                                    it. Author Jane Ponder said that <i>''men and women begin to become great when they

                                    can turn out to be a new business idea, such as Ray Kroc had when he observed the

                                <p> <br>Your combination of intelligences makes you a potential genius, and also makes
                                    you different from
                                    anyone else who has ever lived.Think of yourself this way: Imagine that these 10
                                    intelligences are
                                    like the 10 digits from zero through nine. If you take any large city, you will find
                                    that there are
                                    hundreds of thousands of people with different telephone numbers, even though all of
                                    their telephone
                                    numbers are made up of an area code plus seven digits. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIf you give
                                    yourself a score from zero to nine in each of the 10 intelligences, you will have a
                                    10-digit number
                                    that describes your personal combination of intelligences. This unique combination
                                    of intelligences
                                    forms a kind of personal intellectual telephone number. Your private mental code
                                    number makes you
                                    different from every other person who has ever lived. Like DNA, the likelihood of
                                    someone else
                                    having the same intellectual formula as you is billions to one. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>By developing and exploiting your unique combination of intelligences, you can
                                    perform at
                                    extraordinary levels. You need to first evaluate your intelligences and then grade
                                    yourself in each
                                    one.Next, you identify the special areas of intelligence that you enjoy the most,
                                    the ones that you
                                    have used most successfully in the past. Finally, you look around you and think
                                    about what kind of
                                    work you could do that would enable you to use your special combination of
                                    intelligences at the
                                    highest level. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAbove all, you must develop a greater
                                    respect for
                                    yourself and your potential brainpower. The psychologist Abraham Maslow estimated
                                    that not more that
                                    2 percent of adults were doing all that was possible for them based on their special
                                    talents.You
                                    must therefore develop a higher level of faith and confidence in your ability to use
                                    your mental
                                    powers to overcome any obstacle and to achieve any goal that you can set for
                                    yourself. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THREE WAYS OF LEARNING</b>
                                <p> <br>You have three ways of learning: auditory, visual, and kinesthetic. You can
                                    learn by
                                    <i>listening,</i> learn by <i>seeing,</i> or learn by <i>feeling</i> and
                                    <i>movement</i>. Each
                                    person uses all three modalities to learn, but each person also has what is called a
                                    <i>preferred</i> learning style. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            <li><b>The Visual Learner</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspVisuals like to see things
                                clearly in front of
                                them.They process information with their eyes. They have acute senses of sight and like
                                to meet friends
                                and business associates personally. If you give them verbal information on business
                                results, they will
                                ask, ''Do you have that in writing?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey are avid
                                readers. When you
                                quote a book or a magazine, they will want to get a hard copy to read personally. They
                                like to take
                                photographs, and like to see things rather than to talk about them.Visuals represent
                                about 50 percent of
                                the population. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            <li><b>The Auditory Learner</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn auditory learner likes to

                                to educational audio programs, audio books, music, lectures, speeches, and seminars.
                                They are active
                                conversationalists and prefer to have new ideas and concepts explained to them. If you

                                written report, they will glance at it and ask, ''What does it say?'' <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspAuditories say things like, ''That sounds good to me,'' and ''I hear what you're
                                saying,'' or ''That
                                doesn't sound right.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey are also sensitive to music,
                                and enjoy
                                high-quality stereo equipment, concerts, CDs, and other sound reproductions. Auditories
                                represent about
                                40 percent of the population. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                                or learning by doing and touching. Kinesthetics have a hard time just sitting around.
                                They want to be
                                active, to try things out, often ignoring the written instructions (visual) or verbal
                                instructions
                                (auditory). <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou find kinesthetics in any type of work
                                that requires manual
                                dexterity, such as carpentry, mechanics, construction, and even driving trucks or cars.

                                    will be easy. The next 5 to 10 answers will be harder. The last 10 answers will be

                                    answers and
                                    select at least one answer that you are going to take action on immediately. This
                                    step is very
                                    important! It is your taking action of some kind that keeps the torrent of ideas
                                    flowing through
                                    your mind. As you take action on one idea, another idea for another action will come
                                    to you.

                                    going to implement immediately, you can then perform the 20-idea method on that new
                                    idea, generating
                                    20 different ways to put that idea to work. <br><br>

                            <li><b>BRAINSTORMING WITH OTHERS</b>
                                <p> <br>Mindstorming is an exercise that you can do by yourself. Brainstorming is
                                    something that you do
                                    with others. Brainstorming is a form of mindstorming done in a group, but it has
                                    slightly different
                                    rules. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBrainstorming was originally developed by
                                    advertising
                                    executive Alex Osborn, and was first described in his 1946 book, <i>Applied
                                        Imagination.</i> It has
                                    since proliferated and is used all over the world, in every type of organization and
                                    situation, to
                                    generate ideas for a variety of reasons. It is a very simple process to learn and
                                    use. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            <li><b>Six Steps to Brainstorming</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step One:</b>
                                Assemble the group. The
                                ideal number of people in a brainstorming session is four to seven. Below four, you
                                don't have enough
                                minds to generate a large enough variety of different solutions to the problem. With
                                more than seven
                                people, the group becomes too large for participants to get sufficient opportunity to
                                contribute.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step Two:</b> Do not permit criticism or ridicule. The
                                essential part
                                of brainstorming is that no evaluation of the ideas takes place during the brainstorming
                                session. The
                                entire focus of the brainstorming session is on generating the greatest quantity of
                                ideas possible within
                                a short period of time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNothing kills a brainstorming
                                session faster than
                                the tendency of people to criticize the ideas as they are generated. As soon as one
                                person's ideas are
                                criticized, the brainstorming session comes to a halt. No one wants to be criticized. No
                                one wants to be
                                humiliated or ridiculed in front of others.That is why you must concentrate on the
                                quantity of ideas and
                                leave the evaluation of them to another time, or to other people. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step
                                    Three:</b> Set a specific time limit. The ideal length for brainstorming sessions
                                ranges from 15 to
                                45 minutes. One of the jobs of managers and team leaders is to sit their staff down on a
                                regular basis to
                                brainstorm certain problems. Call everyone together and announce that you are going to
                                brainstorm a
                                particular goal or situation for 15 minutes and then everyone is going to go back to
                                work.You'll be
                                amazed at the results. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step Four:</b> Select a leader
                                for the group.
                                The leader's job is to encourage everyone to contribute as much as possible. One of the
                                best ways to lead
                                a brainstorming session is to go around the table and encourage each person to
                                contribute an idea -
                                almost like playing cards, where you encourage each person to bet or pass. Once you have
                                gone around the
                                table a couple of times, people will start generating ideas at a rapid rate.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp<b>Step Five:</b> Select someone to keep track of the ideas. A key function in a
                                brainstorming
                                session is that of the recorder. This is the person who writes down the ideas as they
                                are generated.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step Six:</b> Be punctual. Start and stop the
                                brainstorming session
                                exactly on time, no matter how well it is going. At the end, you gather up all the ideas
                                and take them
                                away to be evaluated at a later time. <br><br>
                            <li><b>IDEAS ON INDEX CARDS</b>
                                <p> <br>In another type of brainstorming session involving dozens of people, we break
                                    the group up and
                                    distribute index cards to each subgroup. Each of the smaller groups is assigned to
                                    generate ideas in
                                    answer to the question or problem. Afterward, the index cards containing the ideas
                                    are collected.
                                    They are then shuffled and handed out to the subgroups again, completely mixed up.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn the second phase of the exercise, each subgroup is asked to take
                                    the ideas on
                                    the cards that they have received and evaluate them, rating them in terms of their
                                    value prior to
                                    reporting back to the overall group. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn a session
                                    with 20 or 30
                                    people, two or three hundred ideas will be generated in 30 minutes. When those ideas
                                    are gathered,
                                    distributed, evaluated, and reported back to the overall group, the results are
                                    absolutely
                                    astonishing! I have worked with companies that have come up with so many solutions
                                    to problems that
                                    had been stumping them that they did not have enough hours in the day, or enough
                                    people, to take
                                    action on more than a small number of them. <br><br>
