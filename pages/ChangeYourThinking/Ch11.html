                        <p> <br><br>Every successful person has experienced countless temporary setbacks, obstacles, and
                            even outright
                            defeats, in the course of his or her life. But it has been the ability to respond positively
                            and
                            constructively to these defeats and to bounce back that ultimately has assured success. This
                            quality of
                            bouncing rather than breaking will determine your success as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspDr. Abraham
                            Zaleznik of the Harvard Business School did a study some years ago on the role that
                            <i>disappointment</i>
                            plays in life. Many people had researched and written on motivation and its relationship to
                            success. But
                            Zaleznik was the first person who looked at the other side of the coin. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THINKING AHEAD</b>
                                <p> <br>If you are a normal, intelligent person, you will organize each area of your
                                    life to avoid
                                    failure and disappointment as much as possible. You will think ahead and anticipate
                                    what could go
                                    wrong. You will then take the necessary precautions to guard against setbacks and
                                    problems.You will
                                    weigh and balance different options. You will select the course of action that
                                    offers the greatest
                                    likelihood of success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNonetheless, no matter how
                                    well you think and
                                    plan, things will not always turn out the way you expect. Murphy's Law says:
                                    <i>''Whatever can go
                                        wrong will go wrong. Of all the things that can go wrong, the worst possible
                                        thing will go
                                        wrong at the worst possible time and cost the most amount of money.''</i>
                                    Cohen's Law then
                                    adds: <i>''Murphy was an optimist!''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTherefore,
                                    disappointment
                                    comes unbidden. Disappointment comes in spite of your best efforts to avoid it.
                                    Disappointment is
                                    inevitable and unavoidable. As sure as the sun rises in the east and sets in the
                                    west, you are going
                                    to experience disappointments in life. And the more goals you set and the more
                                    things you try, the
                                    more difficulties and problems you will have. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE ONE THING YOU CAN CONTROL</b>
                                <p> <br>What Dr. Zaleznik discovered was that successful people respond to
                                    disappointment differently
                                    from unsuccessful people. His conclusion was that the way you deal with
                                    disappointment is an
                                    extremely good predictor of whether you will achieve success in your field, or in
                                    life overall.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSince you can't always avoid disappointment, no
                                    matter what you do,
                                    the only thing that matters is how you deal with the disappointment when it comes
                                    upon you, unwanted
                                    and unexpected. Do you let it overwhelm you? Do you blow up, become angry, and blame
                                    or attack other
                                    people? Or do you roll with the punches, and respond effectively? <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspSuccessful people deal with disappointment by taking it in stride. Unsuccessful
                                    people allow
                                    disappointment to stop them. Successful people recover and continue forward.
                                    Unsuccessful people
                                    often quit and go back. Motivational speaker Charlie Jones says, <i>''It's not how
                                        far you fall but
                                        how high you bounce that counts!''</i> <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE TRIGGER OF NEGATIVITY</b>
                                <p> <br>Most negative emotions are triggered by frustrated expectations.You wish, hope,
                                    or plan for
                                    something to happen in a certain way, and when it doesn't, you react with impatience
                                    and anger. This
                                    is quite normal. If you care about a result, you are going to be hurt if you don't
                                    achieve it.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe challenge is that emotions are triggered
                                    instantaneously. For
                                    this reason, you can have very little control over your emotions and reactions at
                                    the moment that
                                    something happens to you. It is too late. When the disappointment occurs, you will
                                    react
                                    instinctively and habitually, depending on your previous experiences. When things go
                                    wrong, it is
                                    too late for you to think of fine and noble thoughts.You simply react. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspEpictetus, the Greek Stoic philosopher, once wrote, ''Circumstances do not make
                                    the man; they
                                    only reveal him to himself,'' and to others, for that matter. It is not the adverse
                                    situation that
                                    builds your character so much as it <i>reveals</i> your character as it exists at
                                    that moment.

                            <li><b>PREPARE IN ADVANCE</b>
                                <p> <br>One of the best ways to change your thinking, and your life, is to prepare for
                                    disappointment in
                                    advance. Set yourself up to bounce back quickly by practicing mental prepreparation.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMental prepreparation enables you to prepare internally for the
                                    inevitable
                                    disappointments of life and work, even though you do not know what they are or when
                                    they will come.
                                    This is one of the most powerful of all thinking techniques that you can use to gain
                                    and keep
                                    control of your emotions, assuring that they are primarily positive and
                                    constructive, no matter what
                                    happens. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn mental prepreparation, you begin with the
                                    premise that
                                    you are going to face all kinds of problems and difficulties when you decide to
                                    accomplish anything
                                    worthwhile in life. In fact, if you set a big, challenging goal for yourself, one
                                    that forces you
                                    out of your comfort zone, you are going to meet with countless obstacles and
                                    difficulties that you
                                    cannot now imagine. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis trial by endurance seems to
                                    go with the
                                    territory. Every time you try to be or do something more or different, problems of
                                    all kinds will
                                    arise in your path. If you are not prepared in advance, they can discourage you and
                                    drive you back
                                    into your comfort zone. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspInstead of waiting for the
                                    inevitable
                                    problems to occur, you mentally prepare for these inevitable difficulties before
                                    they happen. You
                                    say to yourself: <i>''Today I will face all kinds of ups and downs, difficulties and
                                        setbacks, but I
                                        will not let them get me down. Once I start toward my goal, I will be
                                        unstoppable!''</i>
                                    <br><br>
                            <li><b>PRACTICE CRISIS ANTICIPATION</b>
                                <p> <br>In business consulting, we teach a way of thinking called ''crisis
                                    anticipation.'' I encourage
                                    decision makers to look six months to a year into the future and ask the question,
                                    ''What are some
                                    of the negative things that could happen that would derail our plans? Of all of
                                    them, what are the
                                    very worst things that could happen?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe then make a
                                    list of all the
                                    different setbacks or unexpected emergencies that could occur that would threaten
                                    the enterprise.
                                    For example: A competitor could come out with a new product or service that was
                                    better and/or
                                    cheaper than ours. Interest rates could go up. Government could place new taxes and
                                    regulations on
                                    our activities. Costs of fuel or raw materials could increase. A key person or
                                    persons within the
                                    organization could depart for some reason. A key customer or customers could leave
                                    and go to a
                                    competitor. Competitors could cut their prices below costs in order to take business
                                    away. The
                                    economy could tip into recession and the overall market could shrink dramatically.

                                    effectively could determine its very survival. These possible reversals and setbacks
                                    should be

                                <p> <br>What works for large and small corporations can work for you as well.You should
                                    practice crisis
                                    anticipation regularly in everything you do. Look down the road of your life, like a
                                    traveler, and
                                    imagine some of the negative things that might happen and how you could respond to
                                    them. You will be
                                    amazed at how much more positive and confident you will feel when you have already
                                    developed
                                    alternative courses of action to some of the worst things that could happen in a
                                    particular area.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example, what would you do if you lost your job
                                    today? The idea
                                    of losing one's job is a major fear for most people, affecting 37 percent of the
                                    working population
                                    according to one study. I received a letter recently from a gentleman who told me
                                    that his fear of
                                    losing his job, which he recognized was completely irrational, was so great that it
                                    was paralyzing
                                    him. It was actually holding him back from doing the kind of work that he had to do
                                    in order to keep
                                    his job. His fear and his lack of alternatives were actually increasing the
                                    likelihood that he would
                                    be laid off. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR NEW JOB</b>
                                <p> <br>Sometimes I ask people in my audiences, <i>''What is your next job going to
                                        be?''</i> For most
                                    people this question comes as a surprise. They have not even thought about what
                                    their next job is
                                    going to be. But we know that the world of work is changing at a rapid rate. The
                                    fact is that you
                                    have already changed jobs several times. It is virtually inevitable that you will
                                    change jobs again,
                                    and perhaps sooner than you expect.What is your next job likely to be? <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspWhen I explain that each person must be preparing for his or her next job, it
                                    is a new idea for
                                    most people. They either have not thought about it or don't want to think about it.
                                    But the only
                                    question is this: ''What level of knowledge, skills, and ability will you require at
                                    your next job
                                    in order to continue to earn the kind of money that you want to earn in the
                                    future?'' <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you don't think about this question in advance, you may be
                                    forced to think about
                                    it when your time has run out and the question is forced upon you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR NEW CAREER</b>
                                <p> <br>After audience members have thought about what their next job is going to be, I
                                    then ask the
                                    second question, <i>''What is your next career going to be?''</i> What entirely new
                                    field, industry,
                                    business, or line of work are you going to be in 5 to 10 years from now?
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspAccording to employment experts, a person starting work today will have an
                                    average of 14 or 15
                                    full-time jobs, each lasting two years or more, over the course of a working
                                    lifetime. He or she
                                    will also have as many as five different careers, in completely different fields,
                                    each of which will
                                    require new kinds of knowledge and different skills. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspMuch of what you
                                    know about your current work will be obsolete within five years. Because of rapid
                                    changes taking
                                    place in every area, your existing store of knowledge, information, ideas, and
                                    skills will be of
                                    little value. These will have no relevance or application to the job market and the
                                    economy of the
                                    future.You will need new knowledge and skills if you want to survive and thrive in
                                    an increasingly
                                    competitive society. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is why Peter Drucker said,
                                    ''The only skill
                                    that will not become obsolete in the years ahead is the ability to learn new
                                    skills.'' <br><br>
                            <li><b>CONTINUALLY THINK AHEAD</b>
                                <p> <br>You probably recall the famous comment by hockey star Wayne Gretzky. When he was
                                    asked by a
                                    reporter for the secret of his success on the ice, he replied by saying, <i>''Most
                                        players are
                                        pretty good, but they go to where the puck is. I go to where the puck is going
                                        to be.''</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis observation is directly relevant to you. Where
                                    is your puck
                                    going to be three to five years from now? Where is your puck going to be 10 years
                                    from now? Taking a
                                    long-term perspective on your work life enables you to make better decisions in the
                                    short term. As
                                    strategic planner Michael Kami says, <i>''Those who do not think about the future
                                        cannot have
                                        one.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspLook into your future and begin to
                                    imagine and
                                    anticipate some of the twists and turns that might occur. If you lost your job
                                    today, how would you
                                    react? What would be your first thought? The great majority of people, when they
                                    think about losing
                                    their jobs, go into a form of panic.They have no idea what they would do.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspHowever, in my work with many thousands of successful people, I have found that
                                    they have one
                                    particular attitude in common. They all know with complete assurance that if they
                                    lost their jobs
                                    they could walk across the street and get another job tomorrow. They are so good at
                                    what they do,
                                    and so confident in their abilities, that job loss to them would be merely an
                                    inconvenience. They
                                    have lots of options. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs I mentioned in Chapter 6,
                                    there is a way to
                                    determine how good you are in your field.What is the number of job offers you get on
                                    a regular
                                    basis? Just as a store or restaurant can measure its success by the number of
                                    customers or patrons
                                    it attracts, you can measure how valued and respected you are for what you do by
                                    counting the number
                                    of people who want to hire you and use your services. How are you doing? <br><br>
                            <li><b>EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED</b>
                                <p> <br>Sometimes I ask audiences what they would do if their entire industry
                                    disappeared overnight. They
                                    shake their heads and they say that can't possibly happen. Then I point out that the
                                    defense
                                    industry in California literally collapsed in the early 1990s and over 400,000
                                    highly competent
                                    defense engineers and executives, with many years of education and experience, were
                                    rendered
                                    obsolete. Their jobs were not only gone; they were gone forever. Each of these
                                    thousands of
                                    competent, capable men and women were forced into the position of going out into the
                                    marketplace,
                                    developing new skills, and going to work in entirely new fields. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe
                                    collapse of the dot-com mania wiped out more than 90 percent of the Internet jobs
                                    and companies that
                                    had sprung up across the country. The collapse in the telecom sector led to layoffs
                                    of many
                                    thousands of workers. The decline in recent years of the frantic investment activity
                                    that had been
                                    seen during the 1990s triggered the layoffs and firings of tens of thousands of
                                    people in the
                                    financial services industries. It goes on and on, and will continue. Only the names
                                    of the
                                    industries will change.This rapid shift in jobs and industries is going to happen
                                    more and more
                                    often to more and more people. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>The world of finance and investments is constantly changing. The markets are
                                    increasingly
                                    volatile. The old philosophy of ''buy and hold'' is no longer relevant to the world
                                    of today, and
                                    tomorrow. If you have money invested, you should be thinking continually about what
                                    might happen if
                                    your investments went bad and you lost all your money.You should always be preparing
                                    against the
                                    worst possible outcome of a particular investment. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThere is a direct
                                    relationship between how much time you invest in thinking about and planning your
                                    financial life and
                                    how likely you are to become financially independent. According to Dr. Thomas
                                    Stanley's interviews
                                    with thousands of self-made millionaires, they share a common characteristic: they
                                    spend far more
                                    time thinking about financial matters than the average person. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp

                                    average adult, even though he or she worries about money much of the time, spends
                                    only two to three
                                    hours per month actually thinking about his or her finances, usually at bill-paying
                                    time. The
                                    average affluent American, in contrast, spends 20 to 30 hours per month thinking
                                    about his or her
                                    money. As a result, they make far better spending decisions and more intelligent
                                    investments than
                                    the majority. They become increasingly skilled in money matters, and eventually pull
                                    ahead of their
                                    peers. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE STRATEGY OF NAPOLEON</b>
                                <p> <br>The French general Napoleon dominated the continent of Europe for almost 20
                                    years. He led his
                                    armies to victory in dozens of battles, and lost only three battles in his entire
                                    career. He lost
                                    almost 600,000 men when he invaded Russia, failing to anticipate the cold of the
                                    Russian winter.
                                    Greatly weakened from the Russian campaign, he subsequently lost the battle of
                                    Leipzig, which led to
                                    his being exiled to the island of Elba. And finally, he lost at the battle of
                                    Waterloo due to a
                                    series of miscommunications with his field generals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIt is often
                                    forgotten that he won many other battles, small and large, and is considered to be
                                    one of the three
                                    greatest military geniuses of history. (Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan were
                                    the other two.)
                                    Napoleon had developed a quality that helped him to achieve victory, which you also
                                    can develop. It
                                    is called <i>extrapolatory thinking.</i> This is the ability to think and plan
                                    several moves ahead
                                    in whatever you are doing. This way of thinking involves your considering every
                                    possible event that
                                    could occur, and then making provisions for them, well in advance. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspNapoleon personally felt that his thoroughness and depth of preparation,
                                    carefully considering
                                    every detail, were his key to victory. This quality was demonstrated by his
                                    phenomenal ability to
                                    arrive onto the field of a potential battle and then to think through every single
                                    possible twist
                                    and turn of the battle to its logical conclusion - before the first shot was fired.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce he had completed his preparations, he could take his position
                                    at his command
                                    center to direct the battle. No matter what news he received from any part of the
                                    battlefield, he
                                    was always ready with an immediate response. Many people thought that his quickness
                                    of response
                                    under fire was because he was a brilliant thinker, which he was, but that was not
                                    the secret of his
                                    success. His secret was that he had thought through every possible eventuality, in
                                    advance. <br><br>
                            <li><b>EXTRAPOLATE FROM THE PRESENT</b>
                                <p> <br>This ability, to think through every major situation in your life in advance, is
                                    a way of
                                    thinking that you can learn with practice.The better you become at anticipating
                                    future events based
                                    on current facts, the better your life will be.You will be able to minimize
                                    reversals and maximize
                                    opportunities. Thinking this way will give you an edge over others who simply react
                                    and respond to
                                    whatever happens. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you work for a company, you
                                    should be thinking
                                    through the worst possible things that could happen in the next six months to a year
                                    that could
                                    affect your job and your security. If you own the company, you should identify the
                                    worst possible
                                    things that could affect the survival and health of your enterprise. You and your
                                    spouse should
                                    discuss possible problems and difficulties that might occur in your family life, and
                                    then make plans
                                    to guard against them. <br><br>
                            <li><b>TAKE NECESSARY FINANCIAL PRECAUTIONS</b>
                                <p> <br>You often read about people who failed to insure properly and consequently lost
                                    their cars, their
                                    homes, and sometimes all of their possessions. They failed to look into the future
                                    and ask what the
                                    consequences to their life would be if a fire occurred in their home or if they had
                                    a traffic
                                    accident and they were not sufficiently insured. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne
                                    of the smartest
                                    things that you can do to preserve your financial well-being is to develop a regular
                                    savings
                                    program.Your goal should be to save 10 percent and more of your income, off the top,
                                    each month,
                                    from each paycheck or income source. There are few things that will give a greater
                                    sense of
                                    confidence and control than for you to know that you have a cash reserve set aside
                                    in the event of
                                    an unexpected emergency. In contrast, there is nothing that will cause you more
                                    stress and tension
                                    than to be living on the edge of your financial resources, unable to deal with a
                                    financial emergency
                                    or a need of any kind. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspW. Clement Stone once said,
                                    <i>''If you cannot
                                        save money, then the seeds of greatness are not in you.''</i> <br><br>
                            <li><b>LIVE WITHIN YOUR INCOME</b>
                                <p> <br>Your ability to save money and to discipline yourself to live within your income
                                    is a key measure
                                    of your ability to succeed in life. If you do not have the internal self-control to
                                    refrain from
                                    spending everything you earn, this suggests that you probably don't have the
                                    discipline necessary to
                                    succeed in other areas of your life. Although the Bible says that the love of money
                                    is the root of
                                    all evil, it is far more likely that the lack of money is the root of all evil.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspPerhaps the greatest benefit of saving your money and building up a cash
                                    reserve is that
                                    it enables you to take advantage of opportunities when they arise, as they always
                                    do. In the movie
                                    Field of Dreams, a profound idea was expressed: ''If you build it, they will come.''
                                    In the
                                    financial world, this means that if you accumulate money through hard work and
                                    saving, you will
                                    attract into your life opportunities to invest that money to earn even more.

                            <li><b>LIVE WITHIN YOUR INCOME</b>
                                <p> <br>The Law of Attraction is very powerful in monetary matters.When you save even a
                                    small amount of
                                    money and put it in a bank account or a carefully chosen mutual fund, you create a
                                    certain force
                                    field of energy around that money. This energy somehow begins to attract even more
                                    money into your
                                    life. As your savings and investments grow, the magnetic power of your money grows
                                    even stronger.
                                    The more money you accumulate, the more money that will be attracted to you, and the
                                    more
                                    opportunities you will have to accumulate even more. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspWhen you think
                                    about your money and the pleasure it gives you to have money in the bank, you
                                    increase the energy
                                    field around your money and you attract even more. This force field becomes even
                                    more powerful when
                                    you love your money. When you think about your growing financial reserves with
                                    intense happiness,
                                    you intensify the energy around your money and you attract even more. <br><br>&nbsp

                                    &nbspWhen people say that it takes money to make money, they are right in two
                                    special ways. First,
                                    your ability to save money and build up a nest egg is a measure of whether you have
                                    the ability to
                                    earn even more money and whether you can be trusted with money. Second, when you put
                                    together even a
                                    small amount of money, you will attract opportunities to accumulate an even larger
                                    amount. <br><br>
                            <li><b>A SUCCESS STORY</b>
                                <p> <br>A participant came up to me at a seminar recently and asked if I remembered him.
                                    I told him that
                                    unfortunately I spoke to too many people each year to remember all of them. He
                                    reminded me that he
                                    had attended my two-day seminar about six years before. He was quite shy so he
                                    waited at the lunch
                                    break until everyone had left. He then told me about a most remarkable series of
                                    events that had
                                    happened to him since the seminar. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen he came to my
                                    seminar, he was
                                    a used car salesman. He had two children and was in his early thirties. He was
                                    earning an average
                                    income and was up to his neck in debt. He was living in a rented house with his
                                    family.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt the seminar, he decided that his biggest source of
                                    worry was the
                                    fact that he was in debt and had no money in the bank. So he set a goal to get out
                                    of debt and to
                                    save $30,000 over the next five years. This was a huge goal for him, considering his
                                    circumstances
                                    and his past. He had not been out of debt since his teens. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>Nonetheless, in faith, he wrote down his goal, made a plan, and began working on
                                    it every
                                    day.This decision activated his mental powers. Because of the Law of Correspondence,
                                    the Law of
                                    Attraction, and the Law of Subconscious Activity, among others, things began to
                                    change for him far
                                    faster than he had imagined. He actually achieved his financial goal in only three
                                    years. He was out
                                    of debt and had $30,000 in the bank. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne day, his
                                    boss, the owner of
                                    the dealership, called him in and asked him if he was interested in a business
                                    opportunity. He was
                                    quite flattered and asked his boss to explain. His boss said that he had observed
                                    how much better he
                                    had become as a salesman, and he had also heard that he had saved up some money from
                                    his income.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis salesman was shy and cautious, and asked his
                                    boss what he had in
                                    mind. His boss told him that he had been approached by the automobile manufacturer
                                    in Detroit and
                                    asked to recommend someone who would be interested in opening a new car dealership
                                    in the same city
                                    in a growing part of town. The boss said he was willing to recommend him, and back
                                    him in this
                                    dealership. He would go in with him as a full partner if he were willing to put in
                                    his money as
                                    well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe final outcome of this story was that his
                                    boss helped him
                                    set up the new dealership; he helped him with all the purchasing, inventory, parts,
                                    service
                                    department decisions, and staffing. After two years, his boss sold the half share
                                    back to him, so he
                                    ended up owning the dealership 100 percent. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThen he
                                    said to me, ''And
                                    today, I'm a millionaire.'' He said, ''Six years ago I was a used car salesman, and
                                    today I am a
                                    millionaire.'' He was one of the happiest people I've ever met. He said if he had
                                    not taken that
                                    advice from the seminar and begun saving his money and getting out of debt, he would
                                    not have been
                                    in a position to take advantage of that opportunity when it came along. He said,
                                    ''Taking your
                                    seminar probably saved me 20 years of hard work, and maybe even a lifetime.''

                                    &nbsp &nbspThis story applies to your life as well. One of the most important
                                    actions that you can
                                    take to remain positive and optimistic is to prepare mentally, financially, and
                                    physically in
                                    advance. Think through what might possibly happen and make plans to prepare for
                                    opportunities. Make
                                    plans and put aside reserves to minimize or escape the consequences of a financial
                                    setback. This way
                                    of thinking, of planning ahead in every area, is a mark of the superior individual.

                            <li><b>TWO MAGIC QUESTIONS</b>
                                <p> <br>Here are two questions that you can ask to turn failure into success. I call
                                    these the magic
                                    questions because of the incredible power they have to improve your life.You can ask
                                    them and
                                    benefit from them after every experience. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first
                                    question is,
                                    <i>''What did I do right?''</i> No matter what you do, or how it turns out, whether
                                    it is a success
                                    or a failure, you should do an instant mental replay of the event and assess
                                    everything that you did
                                    right in that situation. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEven if it turns out badly,
                                    or was a
                                    complete failure, there were always things that you did that were <i>correct.</i> If
                                    you can isolate
                                    the positive parts of your performance and write them down, you will be
                                    preprogramming your mind to
                                    repeat the things that you did right in the next similar situation. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe second magic question is, <i>''What would I do differently?''</i> This is
                                    an excellent
                                    question because it forces you to think positively about what happened and how you
                                    could do better.
                                    Ask yourself, if you had to do it over again, how would you <i>change or improve</i>
                                    your
                                    performance or behavior in that situation? What would you do more of or less of?
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspBe sure to write down your answers. This ensures that you capture them
                                    before you forget.
                                    Each time you try something new or different, immediately sit down with a pad of
                                    paper and answer
                                    those two questions: ''What did I do right?'' and ''What would I do differently?''
                                    Both of these
                                    questions are positive and they both require positive responses.Your answers prepare
                                    you,
                                    consciously and unconsciously, to do even better next time. Both sets of answers
                                    keep you focused on
                                    improvement rather than regret. <br><br>
                            <li><b>POSITIVE VERSUS NEGATIVE THINKING</b>
                                <p> <br>Both winners and losers examine how they performed after an important event. But
                                    underachievers
                                    almost invariably rehash the mistakes they have made, the expenses they have
                                    incurred, and the
                                    failures they have experienced. High achievers, in contrast, those who think
                                    positively about
                                    themselves and their lives, are constantly reviewing the best parts of their
                                    performance and making
                                    plans to repeat those actions the next time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you
                                    think about
                                    what you did right and what you could do differently next time, your mind will be
                                    completely
                                    positive.Your creativity will be stimulated.You will see all kinds of opportunities
                                    and
                                    possibilities for improvement that you would have missed completely if you allowed
                                    yourself to feel
                                    sorry for yourself after an unsuccessful event. <br><br>
                            <li><b>BUSINESS AND SALES</b>
                                <p> <br>If you are in business, you should ask these questions regularly of yourself and
                                    your key staff:
                                    <i>''What did we do right?''</i> and <i>''What would we do differently next
                                        time?''</i> Remember,
                                    most things you try will be unsuccessful the first few times. By asking these
                                    questions, you extract
                                    the greatest value possible from the situation. Treat every experience as an
                                    opportunity to learn
                                    something that can help you next time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you are in
                                    sales, use this
                                    method after every sale. Immediately after a sales call, successful or not, ask the
                                    magic questions.
                                    This quick review will dramatically increase the speed at which you learn and grow
                                    as a sales
                                    professional. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMake this instant replay a part of your
                                    life. Use this
                                    method repeatedly so that it becomes automatic. No matter how disappointing the
                                    setback or
                                    difficulty may be, you will soon be preprogrammed to learn the most from the
                                    situation and to
                                    extract every kernel of good that you can possibly get from it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp

                                    you combine this method with mindstorming - forcing yourself to generate 20 answers
                                    to each question
                                    - you will be absolutely astonished at the number of great ideas and insights for

                            <li><b>THE EDISON APPROACH</b>
                                <p> <br>Thomas Edison, the greatest inventor of the modern age, was convinced that
                                    experimentation was
                                    simply a <i>process of elimination</i>. He therefore kept accurate records of every
                                    experiment. Once
                                    he had decided that an invention was possible, he dedicated himself to eliminating
                                    the ways that
                                    wouldn't work until the only method left standing was the <i>one way</i> that would
                                    work. As a
                                    result, he became the greatest inventor of the modern age and one of the wealthiest
                                    businessmen in
                                    the country.You should do the same. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFrom now on, each
                                    time you try
                                    and fail, shrug it off as a <i>learning experience</i> that just moved you one step
                                    closer to
                                    success. As Henry Ford once said, <i>''Failure is merely an opportunity to more
                                        intelligently begin
                                        again.''</i> <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR RECOVERY RATE</b>
                                <p> <br>When you experience a disappointment of any kind, your natural reaction is to
                                    feel stunned
                                    emotionally.You feel as though you have been punched in your emotional solar plexus.
                                    You feel hurt,
                                    let down, disappointed, and discouraged. You occasionally feel like quitting
                                    altogether and doing
                                    something completely different. These feelings are normal and natural when you
                                    experience
                                    frustration or failure of any kind. The only question is, how long do they last?

                                    stress test. First, they will take your pulse at your resting heart rate.Then they
                                    will ask you to
                                    do some aerobic exercises to raise your heart rate. Once your heart rate is up to a
                                    particular
                                    point, they will measure it again. They will wait one, two, and five minutes after
                                    the exercise, and
                                    again take your pulse. The mark of how fit you are is how rapidly your heart returns
                                    to its resting
                                    pulse rate after exercise. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>With your personality, it is the same. The mark of how mentally healthy you are
                                    can be measured
                                    by how quickly you recover after experiencing a disappointment. Of course, a setback
                                    or reversal
                                    will hurt. It always hurts if what you are trying to do is important to you. But
                                    that's not the main
                                    point. The main point is how quickly you bounce back.Your recovery rate is
                                    everything. If you plan

                                    chapter, your recovery rate will be much faster. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour
                                    recovery rate
                                    is under your control. It is completely determined by the way you think about what
                                    happens to you.
                                    It is not the event itself that affects you, but rather the way that you interpret
                                    the event to
                                    yourself. And this is very much a choice you make. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR INNER DIALOGUE</b>
                                <p> <br>Here are several powerful affirmations that you can use to take immediate mental
                                    and emotional
                                    control over a negative situation. These words quickly neutralize any negative
                                    feelings you might
                                    have. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first thing you say when something goes
                                    wrong is the words:
                                    ''I am responsible!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour natural tendency when
                                    something goes wrong
                                    will be to become angry and upset and either blame someone or something else or make
                                    excuses. But
                                    the moment you say, ''I am responsible!'' you stop blaming someone else for the
                                    problem. By
                                    accepting responsibility, even if it is only for the way you react, you
                                    short-circuit your feelings
                                    of disappointment, anger, and frustration. The instant you say, ''I am
                                    responsible!'' your mind
                                    becomes calm and clear again.You begin to think of positive, constructive things you
                                    can do to
                                    minimize the damage or to maximize the opportunity. <br><br>
                            <li><b>INTERPRET IT POSITIVELY</b>
                                <p> <br>Here is an affirmation that has been extraordinarily helpful to me over the
                                    years. No matter what
                                    has happened, and no matter how disappointed I am, I immediately say, <i>''Every
                                        experience is a
                                        positive experience if I view it as an opportunity for growth and
                                        self-mastery.''</i>
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis statement enables you to assert control over
                                    your emotions. It
                                    forces you to think about how you can learn and grow from this problem. Like the
                                    statement ''I am
                                    responsible,'' these words give you a sense of control and personal power in any
                                    situation.
                                    <i>''Every situation is a positive situation if I view it as an opportunity for
                                        growth and
                                        self-mastery.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then look into the
                                    situation and ask
                                    yourself what you can possibly learn from what has just happened. How can you grow
                                    as a result of
                                    this difficulty? What has this situation been sent to teach you? If you had a divine
                                    force that was
                                    controlling your destiny, and this force was sending you specific learning
                                    experiences to help you
                                    to be successful, what lessons could you find in your current problem? <br><br>
                            <li><b>ONE THOUGHT AT A TIME</b>
                                <p> <br>Your mind can hold only one thought at a time, positive or negative. If you are
                                    constructively
                                    looking for a solution for or a valuable lesson from every difficulty, you can't be
                                    upset or angry
                                    at the same time. If you apply the Law of Substitution and deliberately force
                                    yourself to think
                                    about the positive aspects of the situation, you will always find them.You will then
                                    be able to turn
                                    them to your advantage. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA positive mental attitude,
                                    which means a
                                    positive and constructive response to disappointments and setbacks, is largely
                                    determined by your
                                    feeling a <i>sense of control.</i> Having a sense of control means that you feel you
                                    are in control
                                    of your own life.You feel that you are in charge.You feel that you are in the
                                    driver's seat.You feel
                                    that you are on top of things. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THINK ABOUT YOUR GOALS</b>
                                <p> <br>One of the most powerful ways to bounce back from failure is to put the negative
                                    situation into
                                    its proper perspective. Remember, failure is never final. Most mistakes that you
                                    make are small
                                    relative to the great scheme of things. If you think back, you will probably not
                                    even be able to
                                    remember what it was you were worrying about a year ago, much less three, four, or
                                    five years ago.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe key to your having a sense of control is for you
                                    to develop and
                                    maintain a clear sense of direction.This sense of direction comes from having clear,
                                    specific,
                                    written goals. One of the most powerful ways to keep your mind positive is to simply
                                    <i>think about
                                        your goals.</i> When something goes wrong, think about your goals.When you lose
                                    a sale, or even
                                    a job, think about your goals.When an investment fails or a business deal falls
                                    through, think about
                                    your goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour long-term goals are to be
                                    financially independent,
                                    to enjoy excellent health, to have wonderful relationships, and to do work that
                                    makes a difference
                                    in the world, among others. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you keep your mind
                                    on these goals,
                                    and on what you are doing to achieve each of these goals, you will find that it is
                                    almost impossible
                                    to feel upset or angry. Thinking about your goals empowers you and makes you a more
                                    positive and
                                    confident person. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THINK IN TERMS OF CYCLES AND TRENDS</b>
                                <p> <br>Look at your life as a series of cycles and trends. Think in terms of regular
                                    ups and downs.
                                    Think in terms of summers and winters, falls and springs. When you develop this
                                    long-term
                                    perspective and you see things that happen as part of a larger pattern, you will not
                                    be too caught
                                    up in short-term fluctuations of your fortunes. You become much more capable of
                                    responding
                                    effectively to little problems and difficulties of day-to-day life. You can put
                                    things into proper
                                    perspective. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe sigmoid curve, which looks like an
                                    ''S'' lying on
                                    its side, explains much of human life. It has three phases. In the first phase, you
                                    are struggling
                                    and working hard to figure things out and get established. This is true for a job, a
                                    relationship, a
                                    new business startup, or the introduction of a new product or service. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe second phase comes after you have learned the critical lessons of phase
                                    one. This is the
                                    growth phase, where you make great progress and get excellent results.Your business
                                    expands, your
                                    products and services sell well, your career takes off, and your relationships are
                                    at their best.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThen comes phase three, the decline phase, which
                                    follows phase two
                                    just as the winter follows the harvest season. In this phase, it becomes harder and
                                    harder to get
                                    the same results and satisfactions as in phase two. Sales and profitability are
                                    harder to
                                    achieve.Your job or relationship is no longer as enjoyable.Your company struggles to
                                    survive or
                                    thrive. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhich phase are you in today, in each of the
                                    important areas
                                    of your life and work? What could you do to get into or back into phase two, the
                                    growth phase? What
                                    are the cycles and trends in your life and business? <br><br>
                            <li><b>''DENIAL'' IS NOT A RIVER IN EGYPT</b>
                                <p> <br>Many of our problems in dealing with setbacks and disappointments come from our
                                    resisting
                                    reality.We engage in denial.We become angry and insist that this should not have

                                    the situation as though it were happening to someone else. As a result you become
                                    more constructive
                                    about how the situation can best be resolved.You don't allow yourself to become
                                    emotionally involved
                                    in every little thing that happens to you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAbraham
                                    Lincoln wrote,
                                    <i>''Most people are just about as happy as they make up their minds to be.''</i> In
                                    the Foundation
                                    for Inner Peace's Course in Miracles, it says, <i>''You give meaning to everything
                                        you see.''</i>
                                    Without the meaning or emotion that you attach to an event or circumstance, it has
                                    no emotional
                                    significance for you. And you can change the meaning by controlling your thinking.
                                    You can even
                                    eliminate its negative effect on you altogether by refusing to become emotionally
                                    involved in a
                                    short-term setback. It is up to you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE DECIDING FACTOR</b>
                                <p> <br>Your ability to deal with disappointment in a positive, constructive way will do
                                    more to enable
                                    you to succeed and say more about you to other people than any other single factor.
                                    This is a
                                    learned ability, acquired by practice. Effective men and women are invariably those
                                    who have
                                    developed the ability to respond constructively to the large and small crises that
                                    occur unbidden,
                                    unexpectedly, and unavoidably. You must do the same. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspDecide in
                                    advance that, no matter what happens, nothing will ever stop you. Decide in advance
                                    that, although
                                    you will have countless ups and downs in the course of your life, you will keep on
                                    persisting until
                                    you win through to your goals. When you make this decision in advance, you will be
                                    ready.When you
                                    engage in mental prepreparation, you will be fast on your feet when the inevitable
                                    problems appear,
                                    and be ready to bounce instead of break.You will be virtually unstoppable.

                                    <li>Resolve that you will bounce rather than break. Examine your biggest
                                        disappointment in life
                                        right now and determine how you can learn or benefit from it. <br><br>
                                    <li>Identify the three worst things that could happen to you in the months
                                        ahead.What is your plan
                                        to avoid or minimize their possible negative effects? <br><br>
                                    <li>Select your biggest worry or problem right now and determine how you can learn
                                        and grow from
                                        this difficulty. What is the most important lesson that it contains? <br><br>
                                    <li>Practice the Edison approach to life. Calmly accept that every temporary setback
                                        is merely a way
                                        of identifying a way that does not work. Therefore, it is a success. <br><br>
                                    <li>No matter what happens, think about your goals and what you can do right now to
                                        achieve them.
                                        Get busy. <br><br>
                                    <li>Identify the trends in your business.Which way is the market going? If things
                                        continue the way
                                        they are today, what decisions or changes will you have to make? <br> <br>
                                    <li>Ask two questions about your most recent important experience: What did you do
                                        right? And what
                                        would you do differently next time? Resolve to learn every possible lesson from
                                        every setback
                                        or difficulty.
