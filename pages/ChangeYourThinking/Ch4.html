                            determined by mental
                            concepts.We have moved from the age of things into the ''Psychozoic Age,'' the age of the
                            mind. Wealth and
                            opportunities are contained more in the person you are and the way you think than in the
                            assets you have
                            acquired in life so far.Your future lies more in your ability to apply your mind and

                            work and your life than it does in your current job or situation. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspBecause
                            health, wealth, and happiness are essentially mental, there are very few limits on how much
                            of them you can
                            acquire for yourself. In this chapter, and in subsequent chapters, you will learn many of
                            the simple,
                            practical, proven methods, techniques, and strategies used by high-achieving men and women
                            in every field to
                            accomplish far more than they, or the people around them, ever dreamed possible.You will
                            learn how to break
                            the bonds of limited, conventional thinking, expanding your desires and ambitions so

                                    they touch and creating unlimited opportunities for the creative minority. These
                                    three forces
                                    are the incredible growth in <i>information, technology, and competition.</i>

                                        revolution, combined with the speed of computerized information processing, the
                                        Internet,
                                        and wireless communications, is enabling knowledge in every field to double
                                        every two or
                                        three years. Fully 90 percent of all the thinkers, inventors, engineers,
                                        scientists,
                                        writers, entrepreneurs, and creators of all kinds who ever existed are living

                                        high-speed computers is literally breathtaking.Today, you can e-mail a message

                                        world to dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of people simultaneously, in a

                                        seconds, at a cost of pennies. The World Wide Web gives you access to tens of

                                        impossible for
                                        countries to control their currencies, much less their economies. <br><br>&nbsp

                                        &nbsp &nbspIn the twenty-first century, you will own a laptop computer with a
                                        microchip
                                        that can process one billion commands per second. It will have a long-life
                                        battery and a
                                        built-in cellular telephone, connected to cells and satellites that will enable
                                        you to
                                        communicate instantaneously with almost anyone, almost anywhere in the world.
                                        You will
                                        have your own personal telephone number that will enable anyone in the world,
                                        anywhere, to

                                        are in.
                                        And this telephone technology will probably fit on your wrist like a large
                                        digital watch
                                        does today. <br><br>

                                        is competition. Every business organization wants to generate sales and make
                                        profits,
                                        locally, nationally, and internationally, if possible. To survive and thrive,
                                        each person
                                        and business must be continually seeking faster, better, newer, cheaper, easier
                                        ways to
                                        deliver value to their customers. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEvery advance
                                        in
                                        knowledge and technology creates opportunities that fleet-footed competitors can
                                        grab and
                                        run with to create new products and services to leapfrog each other in their
                                        markets. All
                                        three forces- information, technology, and competition- are multiplying times
                                        each other
                                        to create the greatest rate of change in human history. And if anything, the
                                        rate of
                                        change is going to increase in the years ahead.

                            <li><b>CHANGE CREATES OPPORTUNITIES</b>
                                <p> <br>Fully 80 percent of the products and services that you will be using five years
                                    from now will
                                    be brand-new or completely transformed from today. Probably 80 percent of the jobs
                                    being done in
                                    five years will be new jobs or jobs that have been completely transformed by the
                                    onrush of
                                    information, technology, and competition. And the good news is that every single
                                    change that
                                    takes place opens up more opportunities and possibilities for you to achieve your
                                    goals and make
                                    greater progress, faster than ever before. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe forces
                                    of change
                                    impact everything you do. The rate of change is accelerating week by week and month
                                    by month.
                                    The speed and variety of change is something over which you have no control, and
                                    about which you
                                    have no choice. The only decision you have to make is whether you are going to be a
                                    ''master of
                                    change'' or a ''victim of change.'' Are you going to be a creator of circumstances
                                    or a creature
                                    of circumstances? Are you going to ride the wave and stay ahead of the curve of
                                    change, or are
                                    you going to be bowled over by it and left in its wake? It will be one or the other,
                                    but the
                                    impact of change will be forced upon you, whatever you do. <br><br>

                                    architecture. And
                                    if you want to be financially successful, you study others who have become
                                    financially
                                    successful before you.You find out what they did, and you do the same things, over
                                    and over,
                                    until you get the same results. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMaking money is a

                                    riding a bicycle or operating a computer. Because it is a skill, it is therefore
                                    learnable by
                                    anyone who wants to acquire wealth. If in the past you have accepted the false idea
                                    that you
                                    cannot make or keep all the money you want, it is now time for you to get rid of

                            <li><b>THE GREAT LAW</b>
                                <p> <br>The Greek philosopher Aristotle first articulated the foundation principle of
                                    Western
                                    philosophy in about 350 B.C. It became known as the Aristotelian Principle of
                                    Causality.Today,
                                    we call it the Law of Cause and Effect. This law says that for every effect in your
                                    life, there
                                    are specific causes. It says that everything happens for a reason. Success is not an
                                    accident.
                                    Failure is not an accident, either. What happens to you is not determined by luck or
                                    by
                                    coincidence. It is the result of unchanging law. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMy
                                    journey from
                                    unemployment and poverty to success and financial independence started when I began
                                    to study the
                                    most successful people in our society. My idea was simple: I would find out what
                                    they had done
                                    to accomplish so much, and then I would do the same things. Why reinvent the wheel?
                                    What I
                                    discovered changed my life. It will change yours as well. <br><br>

                                    millionaires in the United States, mostly self-made, having started with nothing. By
                                    1980,
                                    according to the IRS, there were 1,800,000 families or individuals with a net worth
                                    of more than
                                    one million dollars. Today, there are more than five million millionaires, an
                                    increase of 277
                                    percent in 22 years. And most of them are self-made as well.These are men and women
                                    who started
                                    with little or nothing, often broke or deeply in debt, and who gradually accumulated
                                    enough
                                    money to become financially independent. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSelf-made

                                    difficulty, obstacle, handicap, and challenge to overcome that you could ever dream

                                    for generations. Some have excellent educations from the finest universities, and

                                    have had far greater obstacles to overcome than you could possibly dream of, and

                                    on to become successful nonetheless. And what others have done, you can do as well.

                            <li><b>START WHERE YOU ARE</b>
                                <p> <br>When I began studying self-made millionaires, I was living in a rented apartment
                                    with rented
                                    furniture. I had a used car that was not paid for and I was deeply in debt. I was
                                    between jobs
                                    and living off credit cards. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first thing I found
                                    was that
                                    self-made millionaires did things <i>differently</i> from average people, and I was
                                    tired of
                                    being <i>average.</i> I therefore decided to stop doing what I was doing, which
                                    wasn't working,
                                    and to start doing what they were doing. My life has never been the same since this
                                    decision.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt wasn't easy to change my thinking about money and
                                    my financial
                                    future, but eventually these efforts began to pay off. Like a large ocean liner
                                    changing
                                    direction, one degree at a time,my habits began to change. Within five years, I was
                                    out of debt
                                    and making good money. In another five years, I passed the million-dollar mark. When
                                    I look
                                    back, I see that it was no miracle. All I really did was to learn what other
                                    successful people
                                    had done before me and then do the same things until I got the same results.

                                <p> <br>There are a great many myths about self-made millionaires. If you want to become
                                    a self-made
                                    millionaire yourself, you must dispel these myths from your own mind. Remember, as
                                    the humorist
                                    Josh Billings once said, ''It's not what a man knows that hurts him; it's what he
                                    knows that
                                    isn't true.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people have fixed ideas or beliefs
                                    about
                                    themselves and money that are holding them back. These ideas may be completely
                                    untrue, but they
                                    will cut off your chances of success nonetheless. You must get over them. <i>To

                                        have never
                                        thought before.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne myth is that you have to

                                    great education to become rich. Another myth is that you have to start off with a
                                    lot of money.
                                    Some people are convinced that financial success depends on getting a lucky break of
                                    some kind,
                                    like picking a hot stock in the stock market. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNone of
                                    these myths
                                    are true. In fact, a survey of members of the Forbes 400, the 400 richest men and
                                    women in the
                                    United States, found that high school dropouts in the group who made it to the list
                                    were worth,
                                    on average, $300 million more than university graduates on the list. <br><br>

                                    Russians have
                                    come from a system where it has been so extraordinarily difficult to succeed that
                                    when they
                                    arrive in America, believing that America is the land of opportunity, they find that
                                    it is much
                                    easier to succeed than they have ever experienced. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs

                                    for them, they make their dreams come true. Their beliefs become their realities.

                                <p> <br>The past president of General Electric Company, Jack Welch, was considered to be
                                    one of the
                                    best business executives in the world. He said that the most important single
                                    quality of
                                    leadership is what he calls the ''reality principle.'' The reality principle says
                                    that <i>you
                                        must deal with the world as it is, not as you wish it would be.</i>You must
                                    strive to be
                                    completely honest with yourself and your situation.You must refuse to engage in
                                    self-delusion
                                    and the hope that things will work out whether or not you do anything about them.

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEspecially when it comes to building wealth, you must be totally
                                    honest with
                                    yourself. You cannot afford to play games with your own mind if you truly want to be
                                    wealthy.You
                                    cannot wish and hope and pray that somehow you are going to win the lottery or
                                    strike it rich as
                                    a result of luck or some remarkable external circumstance. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOU CREATE YOUR OWN LUCK</b>
                                <p> <br>Often people ask me about the role of luck in success.They are convinced that
                                    luck is a
                                    critical factor in achieving anything worthwhile. They feel that some people are
                                    just lucky and
                                    some are not. They talk about luck as if it were a matter of fate or destiny,
                                    largely
                                    inexplicable. They insist that a person gets to the top of his field largely as the
                                    result of
                                    getting lucky breaks, which they, of course, did not get. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspI have
                                    studied the concept of luck for many years. My conclusion is that luck is a word
                                    that people use
                                    to explain away things that turn out much better than could have been expected. If a
                                    person
                                    achieves great financial success at a young age, people say he was ''just lucky.''

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSome people use luck to describe something remarkably good that
                                    happens that is
                                    out of the ordinary. But it is not luck at all.The fact is that all so-called lucky
                                    outcomes are
                                    really the result of probabilities. There is no such thing as luck. <br><br>&nbsp

                                    &nbspThe Law of Probabilities says that there is a probability for everything that
                                    happens.
                                    These probabilities can often be determined with considerable accuracy. The entire

                                <p> <br>There is a probability that you will become a millionaire in the course of your

                                    lifetime. Today in America, one family in 20 has a net worth of more than one
                                    million dollars.
                                    This means that your likelihood of acquiring a million dollars is one in 20, or 5
                                    percent.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHowever, this also means that your likelihood of not
                                    acquiring
                                    one million dollars, should that be your goal, is 95 percent. These are not good
                                    odds.Your job
                                    must be to improve the odds in your favor. Your aim should be to dramatically
                                    increase the
                                    probabilities of achieving financial independence by doing more and more of those
                                    things that
                                    will help you to achieve your goal. This principle applies to anything you want to
                                    accomplish.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe more different things you do that are likely to

                                    achieve your goal, the more likely it is you will do the right thing at the right
                                    time. If you
                                    set clear, written goals, make detailed plans, and continually upgrade your skills
                                    to increase
                                    your income, you increase the probabilities that you will earn a good living.

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you study money and investments, save and put aside 10 percent

                                    of your income every month, keep tight control over your expenses, and think

                                    your financial life, you will eventually become a millionaire. It is not a matter of
                                    luck. It is
                                    just a matter of probabilities. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PROBABILITIES ARE EVERYTHING</b>
                                <p> <br>Imagine you are an inexperienced dart thrower, slightly inebriated, in a
                                    darkened room,
                                    standing some distance from the dartboard. Even under these conditions, if you throw
                                    enough
                                    darts in the direction of the dartboard, you would eventually hit it. And if you
                                    continued to
                                    throw darts, almost in spite of yourself you would become more accurate. As a
                                    result, by the law
                                    of probabilities, you would eventually hit a bull's-eye. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThis
                                    metaphor explains why people who start off with high levels of desire and

                                    ultimately succeed. They just keep trying. And by the law of probabilities, they
                                    finally win. It
                                    is not luck. They create their own luck by what they do, or what they fail to do.

                                    rested,
                                    clear-headed, and completely prepared. The lights in the room are bright and you
                                    stand at a
                                    reasonable distance from the dartboard. Under these conditions, all of which are
                                    under your
                                    control, the time it would take you to hit a bull's-eye would be greatly reduced.
                                    And of course,
                                    when you do hit a bull's-eye, everyone would tell you how ''lucky'' you were. But
                                    you made your

                                    successful in achieving your goals. You should leave nothing to chance. You should

                                    them start off with little or no money. Most of them start off by saving their money

                                    for a long time until they have enough to start a small enterprise or business. Some

                                    success. The most important quality that self-made millionaires used to explain
                                    their success
                                    was the habit of <i>hard, hard work.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSelf-made

                                    later.
                                    According to many studies and interviews, self-made millionaires work an average of
                                    59 hours per
                                    week. Some work considerably more, especially at the beginning. <br><br>

                                    they are paying high salaries to people who are producing very little of value. No

                                    survive very long under these conditions, and these companies are determined to

                                    year after having started from nothing.Whatever others have done, within reason, you
                                    can do as
                                    well. The very fact that someone else has achieved a particular financial goal is
                                    proof it is
                                    possible for you. The only question is, how badly do you want it? <br><br>&nbsp

                                    &nbspSecond, the reality principle says that if you want to be successful in any
                                    area, you have
                                    to find out what other successful people have done to succeed in that area, and then
                                    do the same
                                    things over and over until you get the same results. As long as you don't try to
                                    fool yourself
                                    and look for shortcuts, you are virtually assured of eventually achieving, and even
                                    exceeding,
                                    your goals. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE 40 PLUS FORMULA</b>
                                <p> <br>Begin today to apply the ''40 Plus Formula'' to your work and your career. This
                                    formula says
                                    that you work 40 hours per week in the United States for survival. If you work only
                                    40 hours per
                                    week - if you work only the number of hours that are required of you - then all you
                                    will ever do
                                    is survive.You will tread water financially.You will make enough to pay your bills
                                    and perhaps a
                                    little more besides, but you will never get ahead and you will never be successful.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAccording to the 40 Plus Formula, every hour that you
                                    put in over
                                    40 hours on your job, or on yourself, is an investment in your future success.You
                                    can tell where
                                    you are going to be five years from now by simply looking at how many hours per week
                                    you put in
                                    on your job. Every hour over 40 that you invest in getting more results for your
                                    employer and
                                    your customers adds up and contributes to your long-term success. <br><br>
                            <li><b>GIVE YOURSELF AN EDGE</b>
                                <p> <br>If you work 45 to 50 hours per week, you give yourself an edge over your
                                    co-workers. If you
                                    work 55 to 60 hours per week, your longterm success is virtually guaranteed.You put
                                    yourself on
                                    the side of the angels. Many self-made millionaires work 70 to 80 hours per week to
                                    get
                                    established in their careers. There are no shortcuts to lasting success.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspI have studied successful men and women in America for more than 25
                                    years. I have
                                    never found a single successful person who got there working only 40 hours, or five
                                    days per
                                    week. The idea of the five-day week, which was promoted by the labor unions as a
                                    great advance
                                    in the life of the working person, has been the cause of more financial
                                    underachievement and
                                    failure than perhaps any other single myth. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact
                                    is that,
                                    especially at the beginning of their careers, all really successful people work much
                                    harder than
                                    the average person. They work 10 to 12 hours per day, six days per week. They work
                                    at this rate
                                    for many months and years, before they reach the point where they can slow down. The
                                    average
                                    self-made millionaire has taken 22 years to get from being broke to having a net
                                    worth of more
                                    than one million dollars. It is not easy and it is not quick. But it is definitely
                                    possible if
                                    you want it badly enough. <br><br>
                            <li><b>WORK ALL THE TIME YOU WORK</b>
                                <p> <br>A key part of success at work is to use your time well, to focus on results, and
                                    avoid the
                                    time-wasting social activities of the poor performers. In correlation with this is
                                    the need for
                                    you to ''work all the time you work.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is a
                                    remarkable idea
                                    for many people. Often employees think about work as if it was an extension of
                                    school.When they
                                    were growing up, they came to think of school as a place where you go to socialize.
                                    You take the
                                    required courses, but the most important part is spending time with your friends
                                    between
                                    classes. School becomes a form of play. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people
                                    think, when
                                    they take their first job, that work is also a place where you go to spend time with
                                    your
                                    friends. This is why fully half of the working day is spent socializing, and in idle
                                    conversation on the telephone with friends and family.Work is seen as a giant
                                    sandbox where you
                                    continue to play as you did in school. You do a little work when the boss is
                                    watching, get a
                                    paycheck, and then go home. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut this is not for you.
                                    If you are
                                    determined to succeed greatly and be paid the very most, you must <i>work all the
                                        time you

                                    wholeheartedly.

                                    with your
                                    co-workers. They say, ''Work is supposed to be fun!'' And this is true up to a

                            <li><b>START EARLIER, STAY LATER</b>
                                <p> <br>Napoleon Hill, the author of <i>Think and Grow Rich,</i> once told the story of
                                    a young man
                                    who started at the bottom of a large organization and eventually moved up into the
                                    top ranks of
                                    executives, passing all the people who had started with him at the same level. His
                                    strategy was
                                    simple. He noticed that his boss came in a little earlier than the rest of the
                                    staff, stayed to
                                    finish up his work, and left a little later than the others. This young man
                                    therefore resolved
                                    to arrive 15 minutes before his boss and to leave 15 minutes after his boss left.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe put his resolution into action the next day. This is another
                                    hallmark of
                                    high achievers:They don't procrastinate when they have a good idea; they take action
                                    immediately. The young man began coming in 15 minutes before his boss and going
                                    straight to
                                    work, continuing all day. When his boss left he would still be at his desk, working
                                    away.
                                    <br><br>

                                <p> <br>The boss said nothing for several weeks. Finally, after work one evening, his
                                    boss came over
                                    to his desk and asked him why he always seemed to be there, even though all his
                                    co-workers had
                                    left. The young man said it was because he was really determined to be successful in
                                    this
                                    company, and he knew he couldn't be successful unless he was willing to work harder
                                    than anyone
                                    else. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe boss smiled and nodded and went on his way.

                                    that, the boss asked him to do something that was not part of his job description.
                                    He did it
                                    quickly and well, delivered it to his boss, and went back to his desk. Soon after,
                                    he was given
                                    another assignment, which he also completed quickly. Within a year, the young man
                                    had been given
                                    several additional responsibilities, each one of which he accepted and fulfilled
                                    immediately.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn his second year, he was promoted to a higher
                                    position. He
                                    studied, upgraded his skills, and continued to work hard. Within a couple of years
                                    he had
                                    surpassed all of his rivals. He had earned the respect and esteem of the other
                                    managers.They
                                    soon promoted him so that he was one of them, rather than one of the staff. His
                                    career took off.
                                    Eventually he became a vice president of the company. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThis is a
                                    simple strategy that works for anyone who is willing to do more than is expected of
                                    him or her.
                                    It works for almost anyone, anywhere, over and over again, year after year. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>If your goal is to become wealthy, you have to know how wealth is created. The
                                    answer is
                                    contained in two words: ''add value.'' All wealth comes from adding value in some
                                    way. All
                                    wealth comes from serving and satisfying your customers better than they could be
                                    served and
                                    satisfied by someone else. Wealth is the result of adding value to them in a way
                                    that no one
                                    else can match. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn your job, you should be looking
                                    for ways every
                                    day and every week to add value and to become more valuable than you were before.
                                    Throughout
                                    your career, your main focus must be to constantly seek out ways that you can add
                                    value to your
                                    boss, to your co-workers, to your customers, to your suppliers, and to everyone else
                                    and anyone
                                    upon whom you rely for your success. This should become your motto: <i>''Add value,
                                        add value,
                                        add value!''</i> <br><br>

                                    &nbsp &nbspIt used to be that a person would work hard for a few years until he had
                                    achieved a
                                    certain level in his job. He could then coast along at that level for many years, if
                                    not for the
                                    rest of his career. His attitude was, ''Well, I've paid my dues. I earned my
                                    position. I did a
                                    great job. Now I am entitled to this job indefinitely.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                                    is no longer good enough. Today, everybody wants to know, <i>''What have you

                            <li><b>TWO SOURCES OF VALUE</b>
                                <p> <br>There are two major sources of value in the world of work today. The first is
                                    <i>time</i> and
                                    the <i>second</i> is knowledge. Today, time is the currency of modern business.
                                    Everyone must be
                                    focused on reducing the amount of time that it takes to get the same results.
                                    Customers will pay
                                    dearly for anyone who can reduce the time needed to get them the products and
                                    services they
                                    want. People will pay more for someone who can satisfy their needs faster than
                                    someone else.
                                    This is why most of the major improvements in modern management are those that
                                    reduce the amount
                                    of time that it takes to get the job done. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most

                                    measure of time is <i>speed.</i> The most important quality that you can develop
                                    with regard to
                                    time is a ''sense of urgency.'' This is the habit of moving fast when opportunity
                                    presents
                                    itself to you. Develop a bias for action. Fast tempo is essential to success. All

                                    dependability. Study after study shows that those individuals with the best

                                    is because the faster you move, the more experience you get. The faster you move,
                                    the more you
                                    learn and the more competent you become.The faster you move, the more energy and

                                    have. People who move fast as a way of life soon develop a totally different
                                    temperament and
                                    personality than people who move slowly or who take a casual attitude toward their

                                    are those who have developed the habits of success. Successful people form good

                                    ensure that those habits govern their behaviors. Unsuccessful people allow bad

                                    and these bad habits then lead to frustration and failure. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                                    &nbspA habit is defined as ''a conditioned response to stimuli.'' It is an automatic

                                    responding or reacting in a particular situation. You develop a habit by repeating a

                                    act or way of thinking and reacting. Once it becomes a habit, it becomes easier to

                                    trained
                                    themselves, like athletes, to do certain things in a certain way, over and over

                                    bit earlier, read and prepare, plan and organize their day on paper in advance, and

                                    before the average person has even started.Thomas Jefferson said, ''The sun has

                                    ago told me
                                    that she discovered the magic of early rising. She had found that by going to bed
                                    early she
                                    could get up at four o'clock in the morning. She could then do the equivalent of a

                                    work by seven or eight o'clock, before the average person even got started. In no

                                    she was producing and earning double the amount of her coworkers. She was

                                    and paid more money because she was getting far more done than anyone else.

                                    &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people make a habit of getting up early, usually by 6:00 or
                                    6:30 in the
                                    morning, sometimes earlier, and then getting going immediately. This gives them a
                                    great jump on
                                    the day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe average person, on the other hand, takes
                                    a full hour
                                    to get up and get going in the morning. Then they drag themselves off to work,
                                    thinking about
                                    lunchtime, and what they are going to do in the evening. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspWhen
                                    your alarm clock goes off, get up immediately and get going right away. Start
                                    moving. Develop
                                    the habit of rising early and starting right to work on your most important task.
                                    This habit can
                                    do as much to assure your success as any other habit you develop. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PRACTICE LOMBARDI TIME</b>
                                <p> <br>When Vince Lombardi took over the Green Bay Packers, the players had developed
                                    the habit of
                                    not showing up until the last moment for games or buses. Often they were late, and
                                    everyone had
                                    to wait. So Lombardi introduced ''Lombardi time.'' This was defined as 15 minutes
                                    earlier than
                                    the scheduled time. Eventually everyone began arriving early, and the problem was
                                    solved.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou should go onto Lombardi time as well. Make a
                                    habit of
                                    punctuality by resolving to be on time, and then practicing it over and over until
                                    is natural
                                    and easy. Less than 2 percent of people are punctual, and everybody notices it, one
                                    way or the
                                    other. Make it a game to be on time - or better yet, early - for every appointment.

                                <p> <br>Here is a powerful three-step formula you can use to double your productivity
                                    and perhaps even
                                    double your income over the next 12 months. It is simple and powerful, and it works
                                    for anyone
                                    who uses it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst, make a decision to come into work
                                    an hour
                                    earlier. This does not take very much effort, and it allows you to beat the traffic.
                                    Have your
                                    work planned out for the day so that when you get into work you can then put your
                                    head down and
                                    go full blast.You will be amazed at how much you can get done before anyone else
                                    comes in.
                                    Research proves that you can do three hours of office work in one hour of
                                    uninterrupted time.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSecond, work through lunch, using the hour when your
                                    coworkers
                                    are all off together eating to get ahead of your work. Resist the tendency to take
                                    an hour off
                                    at ''lunchtime'' or to go for lunch with whoever is standing there. <br><br>&nbsp

                                    &nbspThird, work one hour later, after everyone has left. This third uninterrupted
                                    hour will
                                    enable you to wrap up your work from the day and plan the next day in detail. Also,
                                    by working
                                    later, you will miss the rush hour traffic. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy

                                    early, working through the usual lunch hour, and staying one hour later, you will
                                    double your
                                    productive working time each day.When you combine this with working all the time you
                                    work and
                                    focusing on high-value tasks, you will more than double the amount of work you get
                                    done.You will
                                    quickly become one of the most valuable people in your organization. <br><br>

                                <p> <br>A secretary in Boca Raton, Florida, told me an interesting story at one of my
                                    seminars. She
                                    had listened to one of my audio programs on personal achievement. As a result, she
                                    had set a
                                    goal to increase her income by 50 percent over the coming year from her current
                                    income of $1,500
                                    per month. She told me that she didn't really think it was possible to earn that
                                    much more
                                    because she was part of a large secretarial pool where salaries were fixed. Everyone
                                    made almost
                                    exactly the same. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNonetheless, she decided to look
                                    for ways to
                                    add value to her boss. She noticed that he spent a lot of time replying to routine
                                    correspondence. One day, she took all of his regular mail and wrote replies to them.
                                    She then
                                    took the finished letters to him to edit and sign. He was delighted with her work
                                    and encouraged
                                    her to do more of it. Soon, she was handling 90 percent of his routine
                                    correspondence.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspShe then began to take additional courses to upgrade

                                    in word processing, page making, and report preparation. Bit by bit, she began to
                                    take his
                                    smaller tasks and handle them herself. Each time she took over a smaller task, she
                                    freed her
                                    boss to work on more important tasks. And he noticed. <br><br>

                                    appreciated the work that she was doing for him, and he wanted to increase her pay.
                                    He asked her
                                    not to tell anyone else so that it didn't create any waves around the office. He
                                    then raised her
                                    salary from $1,500 to $1,750 per month. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspShe thanked
                                    him, and
                                    continued looking for ways to help him in his job. Three months later, he increased
                                    her pay
                                    again, and three months later, he increased her salary once more. By the end of the
                                    year, she
                                    was earning $2,250 per month, a 50 percent increase, while the other secretaries
                                    around her were
                                    still earning an average of $1,500. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspShe said it was
                                    absolutely
                                    amazing what happened when she began to focus all of her energies on adding value to
                                    her boss
                                    and to her company. And this same strategy can work for you. <br><br>

                                    people. Since the problems and needs that people have are unlimited, your
                                    opportunities to
                                    create value are unlimited as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEvery fortune

                                    their value to the company. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe primary sources of
                                    value, the

                                    greater. Over 400
                                    years ago Francis Bacon said that <i>knowledge is power.</i> But this is only
                                    partially true.
                                    Only when knowledge is applied to some good purpose is it power.Your job is to

                                    success is determined by your ability to contribute value to your current job,

                                    <li>Identify the most valuable things you do at work. How could you organize your
                                        time so that
                                        you do more of them? <br><br>
                                    <li>Resolve today to develop the habit of punctuality. Go on Lombardi time, and

                                    <li>Work all the time you work. Don't waste a minute. If someone tries to distract

                                        value right where you are. What could they be? <br><br>
