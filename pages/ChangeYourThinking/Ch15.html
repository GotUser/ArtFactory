                        <p> <br>The writing of this book has taken many years of work, reading, teaching, and
                            experience. Many people have
                            contributed to my thinking and have been invisible guides as these chapters came together. I
                            would like to
                            first thank my friend Mark Victor Hansen, who introduced me many years ago to Emmet Fox,
                            perhaps the finest
                            spiritual thinker of the twentieth century. Ernest Holmes, founder of Science of Mind,
                            opened my eyes and
                            heart to the incredible universe of potential contained within each person when they
                            <i>changed their thinking
                                and changed their lives.</i> Great spiritual teachers such as Charles Fillmore, Neville,
                            Eric
                            Butterworth, Wayne Dyer, and Roberto Assagioli have had a profound influence on my thinking.
                            <br><br>&nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI would also like to thank those great practical thinkers on success who
                            have had such a
                            wonderful influence on me - and on the world - such as Napoleon Hill, Maxwell Maltz, Claude
                            Bristol, David
                            Schwarz,W. Clement Stone, Earl Nightingale, Jim Rohn, Zig Ziglar, Dennis Waitley, and
                            Charlie Jones.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBusiness thinkers such as Peter Drucker, Andrew Grove, Ken
                            Blanchard,Warren
                            Bennis,Tom Peters, Nido Qubein, and Marshall Goldsmith have greatly enriched me with their
                            ideas and insights.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI would like to thank my editor, Matthew Holt of John Wiley &
                            Sons, for his
                            unflinching support of this book, and his constant encouragement over the many months that
                            it has taken to
                            write and edit. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNot least, I thank my wonderful wife Barbara
                            and my fabulous
                            children - Christina, Michael, David, and Catherine - for their support and patience during
                            the long hours
                            away from them to finish this book.
                        </p>
