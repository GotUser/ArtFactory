                        </p>
                        <p> <b>- William James</b></p>
                        <p><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce upon a time there was a woman, about 30 years old,
                            married with two
                            children. Like many people, she had grown up in a home where she was constantly criticized
                            and often treated
                            unfairly by her parents. As a result, she developed deep feelings of inferiority and low
                            self-esteem. She
                            was negative and fearful, and had no confidence at all. She was shy and self-effacing, and
                            did not consider
                            herself to be particularly valuable or worthwhile. She felt that she was not really talented
                            at anything.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne day, as she was driving to the store, another car went
                            through a red
                            light and smashed into her.When she awoke, she was in the hospital with a mild concussion
                            and complete
                            memory loss. She could still speak, but she had no recollection of any part of her past
                            life. She was a
                            total amnesiac. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt first, the doctors thought it would be
                            temporary. But
                            weeks passed and no trace of her memory returned. Her husband and children visited her
                            daily, but she did
                            not know them. This was such an unusual case that other doctors and specialists came to
                            visit her as well,
                            to test her and ask her questions about her condition. <br><br>
                            <li><b>STARTING OVER</b>
                                <p><br>Eventually, she went home, her memory a complete blank. Determined to understand
                                    what had
                                    happened to her, she began reading medical textbooks and studying in the specialized
                                    area of
                                    amnesia and memory loss. She met and spoke with specialists in this field.
                                    Eventually she wrote
                                    a paper on her condition. Not long afterward, she was invited to address a medical
                                    convention to
                                    deliver her paper, answer questions about her amnesia, and share her experiences and
                                    ideas on
                                    neurological functioning. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDuring this period,
                                    something amazing
                                    happened. <em>She became a new person completely.</em> All the attention in the
                                    hospital and
                                    afterward made her feel valuable, important, and truly loved by her family. The
                                    attention and
                                    acclaim she received from members of the medical profession built her self-esteem
                                    and
                                    self-respect even higher. She became a genuinely positive, confident, outgoing
                                    woman, highly
                                    articulate, well informed, and very much in demand as a speaker and authority in the
                                    medical
                                    profession. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAll memory of her negative childhood had
                                    been wiped
                                    out. Her feelings of inferiority were wiped out as well. She became a new person.
                                    She changed
                                    her thinking and changed her life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE BLANK SLATE</b>
                                <p><br>The Scottish philosopher David Hume was the first to propose the idea of the
                                    tabula rasa or
                                    blank slate.This theory says that each person comes into the world with no thoughts
                                    or ideas at
                                    all, and everything that a person thinks and feels is learned from infancy onward.
                                    It is as
                                    though the child's mind is a blank slate that every passing person and experience
                                    leaves a mark
                                    on.The adult becomes the sum total of everything he or she learns, feels, and
                                    experiences
                                    growing up.What the adult does and becomes later is the result of this early
                                    conditioning. As
                                    Aristotle wrote, ''Whatever is impressed is expressed.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspPerhaps
                                    the greatest breakthrough in the field of human potential in the twentieth century
                                    was the
                                    discovery of the <em>self-concept.</em> This is the idea that each person develops a
                                    bundle of
                                    beliefs regarding oneself, starting at birth. Your self-concept then becomes the
                                    master program
                                    of your subconscious computer, determining everything you think, say, feel, and do.
                                    For this
                                    reason, all change in your outer life begins with a change in your self-concept,
                                    with a change
                                    in the way you think and feel about yourself and your world. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe
                                    child is born with no self-concept at all. Every idea, opinion, feeling, attitude,
                                    or value you
                                    have as an adult you learned from childhood. Everything you are today is the result
                                    of an idea
                                    or impression you took in and accepted as true.When you believe something to be
                                    true, it becomes
                                    true for you, whatever the fact may be. ''You are not what you think you are, but
                                    what you
                                    think, you are.'' <br><br>
                            <li><b>FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE LASTING</b>
                                <p><br>If you were raised by parents who continually told you what a good person you
                                    were, who loved
                                    you, encouraged you, supported you, and believed in you, no matter what you did or
                                    didn't do,
                                    you would grow up with the belief that you were a good and valuable person. By the
                                    age of three,
                                    this belief would <em>lock in</em> and become a fundamental part of the way you view
                                    yourself in
                                    relation to your world. Thereafter, no matter what happens to you, you would hold to
                                    this
                                    belief. It would become your reality. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you were
                                    raised by
                                    parents who did not know how powerful their words and behaviors could be in shaping
                                    your
                                    personality, they could very easily have used destructive criticism, disapproval,
                                    and physical
                                    or emotional punishment to discipline or control you. When a child is continually
                                    criticized at
                                    an early age, he soon concludes that there is something wrong with him. He doesn't
                                    understand
                                    why it is that he is being criticized or punished, but he assumes that his parents
                                    know the
                                    truth about him, and that he deserves it. He begins to feel that he is not valuable
                                    or lovable.
                                    He is not worth very much. He must therefore be worthless. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspAlmost
                                    all personality problems in adolescence and adulthood are rooted in what
                                    psychologists refer to
                                    as <em>love withheld.</em> The child needs love like roses need rain. When children
                                    feel
                                    unloved, they feel unsafe and insecure. They think, ''I'm not good enough.'' They
                                    begin to
                                    engage in compensatory behaviors to make up for this inner anxiety. This sense of
                                    love
                                    deprivation is manifested in misbehavior, personality problems, bursts of anger,
                                    depression,
                                    hopelessness, lack of ambition, and problems with people and relationships. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOU ARE BORN UNAFRAID</b>
                                <p><br>The child is born with no fears, except those of falling and loud noises. All
                                    other fears have
                                    to be taught to the child as he or she grows up. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                    two major
                                    fears we all develop are the fear of <em>failure</em> or <em>loss</em> and the fear
                                    of
                                    <em>criticism</em> or <em>rejection</em>.We begin to learn the fear of failure if we
                                    are
                                    continually criticized and punished when we try something new or different.We are
                                    shouted at and
                                    told, ''No! Get away from there! Stop that! Put that down!'' Physical punishment and
                                    the
                                    withholding of love, possibilities that scare us and make us feel insecure, often
                                    accompany
                                    these shouts and criticisms. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe soon begin to believe
                                    that we are
                                    too small, too weak, incompetent, inadequate, and incapable of doing anything new or
                                    different.
                                    We express this feeling with the words, ''I can't, I can't, I can't.''Whenever we
                                    think about
                                    doing something new or challenging, we automatically respond with feelings of fear,
                                    trembling,
                                    and a churning stomach.We react exactly as if we are afraid of getting a spanking.We
                                    say, ''I
                                    can't'' over and over. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fear of failure is the
                                    primary reason
                                    for failure in adult life. As the result of destructive criticism in childhood, we
                                    hold
                                    ourselves back as adults. We sell ourselves short. We quit before we even try the
                                    first time.
                                    Instead of using our amazing minds to figure out how to get what we want, we use our
                                    reasoning
                                    ability to create reasons why we can't, and why the things we want are not possible
                                    for us.

                                <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second major fear that holds us back, undermines our
                                    confidence, and
                                    destroys our desire for a happy life is the fear of <em>rejection,</em> and its
                                    expression,
                                    <em>criticism</em>. This emotion is learned in early childhood as the result of our
                                    parents
                                    expressing disapproval of us whenever we do something they don't like, or don't do
                                    something
                                    that they expect. As a result of our displeasing them, they become angry and
                                    withdraw the love
                                    and approval we need so much as children. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fear of
                                    being
                                    unloved and alone is so traumatic for a child that she soon conforms her behavior to
                                    do whatever
                                    she thinks her parents will approve of. She loses her spontaneity and uniqueness.
                                    She begins to
                                    think, ''I have to! I have to! I have to!'' She concludes, ''I have to do whatever
                                    Mommy and
                                    Daddy want me to, or they won't love me, and I'll be all alone!'' <br><br>

                                <p><br>As an adult, a child raised with what is called ''conditional love'' (as opposed
                                    to
                                    unconditional love, the greatest gift one person can give to another) becomes
                                    hypersensitive to
                                    the opinions of others. In its extreme form, he cannot do anything if there is the
                                    slightest
                                    chance that someone else may not approve. He projects his childhood relationship
                                    with his
                                    parents onto the important people in his adult life-spouse, boss, relatives,
                                    friends, authority
                                    figures-and tries desperately to earn their approval, or at least not lose it.

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fears of failure and rejection, caused by destructive criticism
                                    in early
                                    childhood, are the root causes of most of our unhappiness and anxiety as adults. We
                                    feel, ''I
                                    can't!'' or ''I have to!'' continually. The worst feeling is when we feel, ''I
                                    can't, but I have
                                    to!'' or ''I have to, but I can't!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe want to do
                                    something, but
                                    we are afraid of failure or loss, or if we are not afraid of loss, we are afraid of
                                    disapproval.
                                    We want to do something to improve our lives, at work or at home, but we are afraid
                                    that we may
                                    fail, or that someone else may criticize us, or both. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspFor most
                                    people, their fears govern their lives. Everything they do is organized around
                                    avoiding failure
                                    or criticism. They think continually about playing it safe, rather than striving for
                                    their
                                    goals. They seek security rather than opportunity. <br><br>

                                <p><br>The author Arthur Gordon once approached Thomas J.Watson Sr., the founder of IBM,
                                    and asked him
                                    how he could succeed faster as a writer. Thomas J.Watson, one of the giants of
                                    American
                                    business, replied with these profound words: ''If you want to be successful faster,
                                    you must
                                    double your rate of failure. Success lies on the far side of failure.''
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that the more you have already failed, the more likely it is
                                    you are on
                                    the verge of great success. Your failures have prepared you to succeed.This is why a
                                    streak of
                                    good luck seems to follow a streak of bad luck. When in doubt, ''double your rate of
                                    failure.''The more things you <em>try</em>, the more likely you are to
                                    <em>triumph.</em> You
                                    overcome your fears only by doing the thing you fear until the fear has no more
                                    control over
                                    you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR MENTAL HARD DRIVE</b>
                                <p><br>Everything you know about yourself, all your beliefs, are recorded on the hard
                                    drive of your
                                    personality, in your self-concept. Your self-concept precedes and predicts your
                                    levels of
                                    performance and effectiveness in everything you do. Because of the law of
                                    correspondence, you
                                    always behave on the outside in a manner consistent with your self-concept on the
                                    inside. All
                                    improvement in your life therefore begins with an improvement in your self-concept.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou have an <em>overall</em> self-concept that is
                                    made up of all
                                    your beliefs about yourself and your abilities. This bundle of beliefs includes all
                                    the
                                    experiences, decisions, successes, failures, ideas, information, emotions, and
                                    opinions of your
                                    life up to now. This general self-concept determines how and what you think and feel
                                    about
                                    yourself, and measures how well you are doing in general. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR MINI-SELF-CONCEPTS</b>
                                <p><br>You have a series of ''mini-self-concepts'' as well. These mini-selfconcepts
                                    combine to make up
                                    your overall self-concept.You have a self-concept for every area of your life that
                                    you consider
                                    important. This mini-self-concept determines how you think, feel, and perform in
                                    that area.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example, you have a self-concept for how healthy
                                    and fit you
                                    are, and how much you eat or exercise.You have a self-concept for how likable and
                                    popular you
                                    are with others, especially with members of the opposite sex.You have a self-concept
                                    for what
                                    kind of a spouse or parent you are, for how good a friend you are to your friends,
                                    how smart you
                                    are, and how well you learn.You have a selfconcept for every sport you play, and for
                                    every
                                    activity you engage in, including how well you drive your car. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp
                                    &nbspYou have a self-concept for how well you do your work, and for how well you do
                                    each part of
                                    your work. You have a selfconcept for how much money you make and how well you save
                                    and invest
                                    it. This is a critical area. The fact is that you can never earn much more or less
                                    than your
                                    self-concept level of income. If you want to make more money, you have to change
                                    your beliefs
                                    about yourself relative to income and money. This is an important part of this book.

                                <p><br>In every case, if you want to change your performance and your results in any
                                    area of your
                                    life, you have to change your selfconcept- or your beliefs about yourself-for that
                                    area.
                                    Fortunately, your beliefs are largely subjective. They are not always based on
                                    facts. Instead,
                                    they are based largely on information you have taken in and accepted as true,
                                    sometimes with
                                    very little evidence or proof. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe very worst beliefs
                                    you can
                                    have are <em>self-limiting beliefs</em> of any kind. These are beliefs about
                                    yourself that cause
                                    you to feel somehow limited or deficient in a particular area. These beliefs are
                                    seldom true,
                                    but if you accept them as valid estimates of your ability, they become true for you,
                                    exactly as
                                    if they were correct. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe starting point of unlocking
                                    your
                                    potential, and accomplishing more than you ever have before, is for you to
                                    <em>challenge </em>
                                    your selflimiting beliefs. You begin this process of freeing yourself from
                                    self-limiting beliefs
                                    by imagining that, whatever they are, they are completely untrue. Imagine for the
                                    moment that
                                    you have no limitations on your abilities at all. Imagine that you could be, do, or
                                    have
                                    anything you really wanted in life. Imagine that your potential is unlimited in any
                                    way.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example, imagine that you could be earning twice
                                    as much as
                                    you are earning today. Imagine that you could be living in a bigger house, driving a
                                    better car,
                                    and enjoying a more expensive lifestyle. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspImagine that
                                    you have
                                    the ability to be one of the top people in your field. Imagine that you are one of
                                    the most
                                    popular, powerful, and persuasive personalities in your social and business world.
                                    Imagine that
                                    you are calm, confident, and unafraid of anything. Imagine that you could set and
                                    achieve any
                                    goal you put your mind to. This is how you begin changing your thinking and changing
                                    your life.

                            <li><b>THREE PARTS OF YOUR SELF-CONCEPT</b>
                                <p><br>Your self-concept has three parts, like a pie divided into three wedges. Each is
                                    linked with
                                    each of the others. All three elements together make up your personality.They
                                    largely determine
                                    what you think, feel, and do, and everything that happens to you. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspYour <em>self-ideal</em> is the first part of your personality and your
                                    selfconcept. Your
                                    self-ideal is made up of all of your hopes, dreams, visions, and ideals.Your
                                    self-ideal is
                                    composed of the virtues, values, and qualities that you most admire in yourself and
                                    others. Your
                                    self-ideal is the person you would most like to become, if you could be a perfect
                                    person in
                                    every way. These ideals guide and shape your behavior. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspGreat men
                                    and women, leaders, and people of character are very clear about their values,
                                    visions, and
                                    ideals. They know who they are and what they believe in.They set high standards for
                                    themselves,
                                    and they don't compromise those standards. They are men and women that others can
                                    look up to and
                                    depend on.They are definite and distinct in their interactions with others. In
                                    everything they
                                    do, they strive to live up to their ideals. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE WAY YOU SEE YOURSELF</b>
                                <p><br>The second part of your self-concept is your <em>self-image.</em> This is the way
                                    you see
                                    yourself and think about yourself. It is often called your ''inner mirror.'' It is
                                    where you
                                    look internally to see how you should behave in a particular situation. Because of
                                    the power of
                                    your self-image, you always perform on the <em>outside</em> consistent with the
                                    picture you have
                                    of yourself on the <em>inside.</em> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe discovery of
                                    the
                                    self-image, pioneered by Maxwell Maltz, is a major breakthrough in understanding
                                    human
                                    performance and effectiveness. By visualizing and imagining yourself performing at
                                    your best in
                                    an upcoming situation, you send a message to your subconscious mind.Your
                                    subconscious mind
                                    accepts this message as a command, and then coordinates your thoughts, words, and
                                    actions so
                                    that they fit a pattern consistent with the picture you created. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp
                                    &nbspAll improvement in your life begins with an improvement in your mental
                                    pictures.Your
                                    internal images influence your emotions, your behaviors, your attitudes, and even
                                    the way other
                                    people respond to you. The development of a positive self-image is a vital part of
                                    changing your
                                    thinking and changing your life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF</b>
                                <p><br>The third part of your self-concept is your <em>self-esteem.</em> This is the
                                    emotional
                                    component of your personality, and is the most important factor in determining how
                                    you think,
                                    feel, and behave. Your level of self-esteem largely determines much of what happens
                                    to you in
                                    life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour self-esteem is best defined as <i>how much
                                        you like
                                        yourself.</i> The more you like yourself, the better you perform at anything you
                                    attempt.
                                    And by the law of reversibility, the better you perform, the more you like yourself.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour self-esteem is the ''reactor core'' of your
                                    personality. It
                                    is the energy source that determines your levels of confidence and enthusiasm. The
                                    more you like
                                    yourself, the higher will be the standards you will set for yourself. The more you
                                    like
                                    yourself, the bigger the goals you will set for yourself and the longer you will
                                    persist in
                                    achieving them. People with high self-esteem are virtually unstoppable.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspYour level of self-esteem determines the quality of your relationships
                                    with others.
                                    The more you like and respect yourself, the more you like and respect others and the
                                    better they
                                    feel toward you. In your business life and career, your personal level of
                                    self-esteem will be
                                    the critical factor that determines whether or not people will buy from you, hire
                                    you, enter
                                    into business dealings with you, and even lend you money. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThe
                                    better your self-esteem, the better you will be as a spouse and parent. High
                                    self-esteem parents
                                    raise high self-esteem children. These children develop high levels of
                                    self-confidence and
                                    associate with other high self-esteem children. High self-esteem homes are
                                    characterized by
                                    love, laughter, and happiness for everyone who lives there. <br><br>

                                <p><br>Your level of self-esteem is largely determined by how closely your self-image -
                                    your current
                                    performance and behavior - matches your self-ideal - your picture of how you would
                                    perform if
                                    you were at your very best.You are always comparing your actual performance with
                                    your ideal
                                    performance at an unconscious level.Whenever you feel that you are living up to your
                                    very best,
                                    you feel terrific about yourself.Your self-esteem soars.You feel happy and
                                    fulfilled.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhenever you do or say something that is not in

                                    ideals or the best of which you feel you are capable, your selfesteem goes
                                    down.Whenever there
                                    is a wide separation between the person you are in the moment and the ideal person
                                    you want very
                                    much to be in the future, you feel badly about yourself. This is why you get angry
                                    with yourself
                                    whenever you fail at something, or behave badly in a situation with other
                                    people.Your self-ideal
                                    continually reminds you of how much better a person you can be. <br><br>

                                <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPsychologists agree today that your self-esteem lies at
                                    the core of your
                                    self-concept and your personality. Every improvement in any part of your personality
                                    or
                                    performance boosts your self-esteem, and causes you to like and respect yourself
                                    even more. The
                                    more you like yourself, the better will be your self-image and subsequent
                                    performance, and the

                                    others, and the less you fear criticism. The more you like yourself, the more you

                                    your life are determined by your <i>basic premises.</i> These are the ideas,
                                    beliefs, opinions,
                                    and conclusions you have come to as the result of inputs and experiences starting in
                                    childhood.They constitute not only your self-concept, but also your <i>philosophy of
                                        life</i>.The more adamant and convinced you are of your basic premises, the more
                                    they
                                    predict and control everything you do, say, and feel. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspIf you
                                    believe yourself to be an excellent person, loaded with talent and ability, friendly
                                    and
                                    popular, healthy and energetic, curious and creative, and destined to have a

                                    these basic premises will lead you to set goals, work hard, develop yourself, treat
                                    others well,
                                    bounce back from adversity, and ultimately succeed. Nothing will be able to stop you

                                    by your own imagination. And since your imagination is unlimited, your future is

                            <li><b>DISSOLVING THE MYTHS</b>
                                <p><br>Unfortunately, there are several myths that we accept as we grow up that can
                                    sabotage our hopes
                                    for success, joy, and fulfillment later in life. Let's look at these self-limiting
                                    beliefs one
                                    at a time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first and worst is summarized in the
                                    feeling,
                                    ''I'm not good enough.'' This is the basic premise that causes feelings of
                                    inferiority and
                                    inadequacy.We assume that other people are better than we are just because, at the
                                    moment, they
                                    are doing better than we are.We feel that they must be worth more than us.
                                    Therefore, we must be
                                    worth less than them. This feeling of worthlessness sits deep in the psyche and
                                    causes us to
                                    sell ourselves short.We settle for less than we are truly capable of. Rather than to
                                    fail at a
                                    new goal, we don't set it in the first place. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                    correct basic
                                    premise for you to develop, or belief for you to have, is that not only are you good
                                    enough, but
                                    you have the ability to be excellent in any area that is important to you.You have
                                    unlimited
                                    potential to be, do, and have more than you have ever achieved up to now. As William
                                    Shakespeare
                                    said in The Tempest, ''What's past is prologue.''Whatever you have accomplished in
                                    the past is
                                    only a hint of what you can do in the future. <br><br>
                            <li><b>TALK TO YOURSELF POSITIVELY</b>
                                <p><br>The most powerful words in your vocabulary are the words that you say to yourself
                                    and
                                    believe.Your self-talk, your inner dialogue, determines 95 percent of your
                                    emotions.When you
                                    talk to yourself, your subconscious mind accepts these words as commands. It then
                                    adjusts your
                                    behavior, your self-image, and your body language to fit a pattern consistent with
                                    those words.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFrom now on, talk to yourself only in terms of what
                                    you want to
                                    be and do. <i>Refuse to say anything about yourself that you do not sincerely desire
                                        to be
                                        true.</i>. Repeat the powerful, positive words, ''I can do it!'' over and over.
                                    Prior to
                                    any event of importance, repeat the words, ''I like myself!'' Say, ''I'm the best!
                                    I'm the best!
                                    I'm the best!'' again and again like you really mean it.Then, stand up straight and
                                    strong, put
                                    a confident smile on your face, and do the very best of which you are capable. Soon
                                    it will
                                    become a habit. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOU DESERVE THE BEST</b>
                                <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs the result of previous destructive criticism, people
                                    accept another
                                    myth, or self-limiting belief. It is that they don't really believe that they
                                    deserve to be
                                    successful. This deep inner feeling of undeservingness is quite common among those
                                    of us who
                                    started off with very little in life, or who came from families that had little
                                    money when we
                                    were growing up. It can also be caused by people who told us at a young age that to
                                    be poor is
                                    virtuous but to be rich is sinful. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you have grown
                                    up feeling
                                    undeserving of good things, for any reason, and you do achieve success in your
                                    field, you may
                                    experience what is called the ''imposter syndrome.''You will feel that you are an
                                    imposter in
                                    your success, and that you are going to be found out. No matter how successful you
                                    become as the
                                    result of your hard work, you will have a nagging fear that it will all be taken
                                    away from you.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you feel like an imposter, you will often feel
                                    guilty for
                                    achieving greater success than others. To escape these feelings of guilt, many
                                    people engage in
                                    self-sabotage. They eat too much, drink too much, take dope, ignore their families,
                                    engage in
                                    unpredictable behaviors, and often throw their money away in extravagant living and
                                    unwise
                                    investments. They feel deep down inside that they don't deserve their success. As a
                                    result, they
                                    often drive it away. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DEDICATE YOURSELF TO SERVING OTHERS</b>
                                <p><br>The truth is that you deserve everything you can rightfully earn by doing an
                                    excellent job, and
                                    producing or distributing products or services that improve people's lives and work.
                                    In a market
                                    society such as ours, all transactions are <i>voluntary.</i> People buy something
                                    only if they
                                    feel that they are going to be better off as a result.You can therefore be
                                    successful in the
                                    long run only by providing people with the things they want to improve their lives
                                    and work. The
                                    more and better you serve other people, the more you both deserve and earn.

                                    &nbsp &nbspThe word ''deserve'' comes from the two Latin words, ''de-'' which means
                                    ''from'' and
                                    ''servire'' which means ''to serve.'' Therefore, the word ''deserve'' means ''from
                                    service.''
                                    The people who do the best in our society, with few exceptions, are those who are
                                    serving other
                                    people better than someone else.Your whole focus in your career should be on serving
                                    other
                                    people better. Then you will deserve every dollar you earn. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp

                                    &nbspAbraham Lincoln once said, ''The very best way to help the poor is not to

                                    them.'' In our society, the more financially successful you are, the more taxes you
                                    are likely
                                    to pay. These taxes help pay for the schools, hospitals, roads, welfare, Medicare,
                                    military
                                    expenditures, and all the important things that our society offers.You can be proud
                                    to be
                                    financially successful. By making a lot of money, you make a significant
                                    contribution to lots of

                                    express it
                                    in everything you say and do. Over time, it will become true for you.Your ideal will
                                    become your
                                    reality. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRepeat to yourself, ''I like myself and l
                                    love my life.

                            <li><b>THE MENTAL SOFTWARE STORE</b>
                                <p><br>Imagine that there was a store that sold mental programming.You could purchase
                                    any
                                    self-concept, belief, or attitude that you wanted and install it in your brain, and
                                    that is the
                                    person you would be from then on. If such a store existed, and you could buy any set
                                    of beliefs,
                                    what would you choose? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is a suggestion. Look
                                    around you and
                                    find out what the happiest and most successful people in your world have developed
                                    as their core
                                    beliefs, and then get the same set of beliefs for yourself. Load them onto your
                                    mental hard
                                    drive and start running the same programs they are running. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp
                                    &nbspFortunately, based on hundreds of interviews with successful people, we know
                                    exactly how
                                    they are programmed and what beliefs they have developed from an early age.The most
                                    important
                                    core belief you can adopt for yourself is this: ''I am a thoroughly good person and
                                    I am going
                                    to be a big success in life. Everything that happens to me, good or bad, is simply a
                                    part of the
                                    process of achieving the great success and happiness that is inevitable for me.''
                                    <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you absolutely believed that you were guaranteed to be happy and
                                    successful,
                                    and that every setback or obstacle was sent to you to teach you important lessons
                                    that you
                                    needed to know to achieve your goals, you would be completely unstoppable. You would
                                    be positive
                                    and optimistic most of the time.You would set big goals for yourself and bounce back
                                    quickly
                                    from any temporary defeat.Your belief would eventually become your reality. By
                                    changing your
                                    thinking, you would change your life. <br><span>
