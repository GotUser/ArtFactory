                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">
                                1. Organization
                            </a></p>
                        <p>One of the most frequently mentioned habits of those who are successful in life
                            is organization.
                            Such organization includes planning as well as setting priorities and goals.</p>

                        <p>prioritize “To-Do List” every evening before going to bed to prepare for the
                            next day. </p>


                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 2. Relaxation</a></p>
                        <p>It’s interesting to note that relaxing – by meditating or simply avoiding
                            distractions – is another
                            of the most-often mentioned habits of successful people.
                        </p>
                        <p>Of course, relaxation comes more easily to those who are organized, so perhaps
                            for some, it is more
                            of a natural byproduct than a conscious decision.
                        </p>
                        <p>It may also be that the act of “taking a breath” is the successful person’s way
                            of preparing for the
                            effort yet to come. In fact, one of the first steps toward achieving a meditative or relaxed
                            state is to
                            concentrate on your own breathing for three to five minutes.
                        </p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 3. Taking Action</a></p>
                        <p>Third on the list of habits of successful people is the inevitable “action”
                            habit. It is important
                            to organize, to plan, and to set priorities, but without action, a plan is nothing more than
                            potential.
                        </p>
                        <p>Successful people act – quickly and often. In addition, although it may sound
                            counterintuitive,
                            according to James Clear, they act (start, anyway) before they feel ready. While others come
                            up with reasons not
                            to act, successful people take that all-important first step – even if it seems outlandish.
                        </p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 4. Personal Care</a></p>
                        <p>Personal care with regard to diet, exercise, and hygiene comes next on the list
                            of habits of those
                            who are successful.
                        </p>

                        <p>For some, personal care involves a complex regimen and a highly disciplined
                            lifestyle. For others,
                            not so much. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, put it succinctly when asked what daily
                            habit has had the largest
                            positive impact on his life. In a tweet, Musk said simply, “Showering.”
                        </p>

                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 5. Positive Attitude</a></p>
                        <p>According to many successful people, having a positive attitude is not just a
                            result of being
                            successful – it’s one of the root causes of success.
                        </p>
                        <p>Joel Brown refers to gratitude and positive self-talk as priorities in the
                            lives of the
                            ultra-successful. Moreover, Brown says, it’s not enough to express gratitude and a positive
                            attitude. You must
                            also remind yourself why you are grateful in order to achieve a deeper effect.
                        </p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 6. Networking</a></p>
                        <p>Successful people know the value of exchanging ideas with others through
                            networking. They also know
                            the value of collaboration and teamwork – all of which are likely when you network.
                        </p>
                        <p>Successful people know the importance of surrounding themselves with other
                            successful people,
                            according to author Thomas Corley. Corley says 79% of wealthy people spend at least five
                            hours a month networking.
                        </p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 7. Frugality</a></p>
                        <p>Frugal is not the same as stingy. Frugality is a habit of being thrifty, with
                            money and resources.
                            It is also a habit of being economical. Learning to be economical comes through avoiding
                            waste, which
                            automatically results in efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>Corley notes that wealthy, successful people avoid overspending. Instead, they
                            comparison-shop and
                            negotiate. The result, according to Corley, is financial success through the simple act of
                            saving more money than
                            they spend.
                        </p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 8. Rising Early</a></p>
                        <p>The more time one can devote to being successful, the more likely success will
                            result. Successful
                            people are accustomed to rising early, and that habit appears repeatedly among those who do
                            well in life.
                        </p>
                        <p>While the “Early Riser’s Club” has a huge membership among successful people, a
                            few notable members
                            include Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Group, Disney CEO Robert Iger and Yahoo’s Marissa
                            Mayer.
                        </p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 9. Sharing</a></p>
                        <p>Whether through donating to charity or the sharing of ideas, successful people
                            have a habit of
                            giving. They know the value of sharing and most believe their success should result in
                            something more than the
                            accumulation of wealth for themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some of the most well-known successful philanthropists include Bill and Melinda
                            Gates, Oprah Winfrey
                            and Mark Zuckerberg.
                        </p>
                        <p>Lack of wealth does not need to be a factor when it comes to sharing.
                            Volunteering in your community
                            or at a local school does not cost anything but could provide help where it is needed most,
                            as KeepInspiring.Me
                            points out.
                        </p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button"> 10. Reading</a></p>
                        <p>It's important to note that successful people read. While they also read for
                            pleasure, most use
                            their reading habit as a means to gain knowledge or insight.
                        </p>
                        <p>For anyone who needs inspiration about the value and importance of reading,
                            look no further than the
                            example of billionaire author, J.K. Rowling, who says she read “anything” as a child. She
                            advises, “Read as much
                            as you possibly can. Nothing will help you as much as reading.”
                        </p>
                        <p>The Bottom Line</p>
                        <p>Most people have habits – some are positive, some are not. Successful people
                            tend to have more of
                            the kinds of habits that contribute to their success.
                        </p>
                        <p>The good news, for those who wish to be successful, is that cultivating
                            positive habits takes no
                            more effort than developing bad ones.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some of the best habits of successful people involve only conscious effort,
                            like getting up early
                            every day. Others, such as becoming organized, may take a little more skill and practice but
                            ultimately result in
                            the most desired outcome of all – success.
