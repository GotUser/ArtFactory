                        </blockquote>
                        <p>We’re not so different from robots. As we get older, we live our lives in loops just as
                            closed as robots. That’s why Warren
                            Buffett stresses getting your habits right early on.</p>
                        <p>I was reading the book The Power of Habits.</p>
                        <p>It tells the story of a man called
                            Eugene, who recently suffered from some&nbsp;brain injuries. This&nbsp;caused him to have a
                            short memory (1 minute or less) and therefore, he could
                            not function like a normal human being.</p>
                        <p>The crazy part was that scientists studied him and found that he still somehow able to go for
                            a daily
                            walk around the neighborhood and remember where his house was.</p>

                        <p>Warren Buffett said that forming great
                            habits are one of the great keystones to success. He said they are easier to form&nbsp;when
                            you are younger so it is better to start
                            early.</p>
                        <p>That’s what lead me down a path to learn how to forge good habits and improve bad habits.
                            After all, Mr. Buffett is one of the most
                            successful businessmen in history and are lives are based around habits. We are creatures of
                            habit.</p>
                        <p>But how do you actually form and change
                            habits?</p>
                        <p>Most people fail at this because they try to change their habits based on their family’s (or
                            Uncle Joe’s) bad advice and hope for the
                            best. And nothing changes. They fail to go to the gym consistently. They still eat junk food
                            when they get home or do drugs. They still watch an hour
                            of TV a day even though they know it’s bad for them.</p>
                        <p>And they give up trying.</p>
                        <p>Instead, let’s turn to&nbsp;science&nbsp;to
                            see&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>it’s so hard to change habits. Because this book reveals new
                            techniques &nbsp;on how you can actually change habits. I’m
                            going to show you how today.</p>

                                The Science Of Forming Habits
                            </a></p>

                        <p>Let’s get back to Eugene’s story:</p>
                        <p>Eugene could barely function on
                            his own. Yet his morning routine stayed the same because of his ingrained habits. This is
                            because habits are behaviors that are bodies make automatic
                            (like muscle memory) so that we do not have to think consciously about them to make them
                            happen, which frees us up to think about other
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>This is a great time saver. Think about when you first drove a car. The first time, you were
                            worried about everything from the steering
                            wheel to the brakes. After a while, everything becomes automatic.</p>
                        <p>That’s what happened with Eugene. They found that he was able to remember how
                            to walk around the neighborhood everyday, cook breakfast, and find his house because of a
                            key process to habit formation:</p>
                        <p>Triggers. These two
                            elements are the core to forming (or breaking) any habit.</p>
                        <p>Despite his memory loss, Eugene saw visual cues that reminded his body of where to go
                            next even though his memory was blank.</p>
                        <p>He woke up and went on a walk because his body wanted to, not because he really thought about
                            it.</p>
                        <p>He was clueless when experimenters asked where his house was throughout his walk. But his
                            body unconsciously followed visual cues around the
                            neighborhood that lead him back home.</p>
                        <p>They tested this by removing one or two triggers (such as certain trees or areas of the
                            neighborhood). And
                            it was true. He could not complete his walk.</p>
                        <p>They tested this theory again with a card game experiment involving Eugene.</p>
                        <p>The card game was
                            a memory exercise that required flipping over the card to confirm if you were right.</p>
                        <p>Despite his horrible memory, he&nbsp;was able to score very
                            well in the game.</p>
                        <p>Scientists discovered the biological process for how a habit is formed…</p>
                        <p><strong>Write this down. This is how habits are
                                formed:</strong></p>
                        <p>Triggers (also called Signs or Cues)-&gt; Routines -&gt; Reward -&gt; Repeat until habit
                            forms.</p>
                        <p>Triggers and signs are
                            the things that cause or trigger a habit before it begins or while it’s happening: an itchy
                            fingertip might trigger the habit of biting your nails.
                            Signs are things that occur during your habit: a daily habit of walking the neighborhood has
                            expected signs that are the same each time: the same
                            trees in the same places and the same houses or smells.</p>
                        <p>If enough triggers or signs are missing, the habit will not awaken or form.</p>
                        <p>A
                            standard routine repeated over and over with key triggers and signs with a expected reward
                            at the end ultimately creates a habit.</p>
                        <p>Scientists
                            found that we form habits to be able to use our brain power for other things. They also
                            found that the body cannot tell what is a good or bad
                            habit.</p>
                        <h3><span>How did they
                                find this and what does it
                                mean?</span></h3>
                        <p>They used rats. They wired their brains up with tons of wires and found that after repeating
                            a routine numerous times, the level
                            of brain activity needed goes down incredibly.</p>
                        <p>It makes sense.</p>
                        <p>When you’re first driving a car, you’re focused on getting everything
                            right: backing up so you don’t hit anyone, making sure the brake is off, pushing the pedal
                            down slowly, and so on.</p>
                        <p>Overtime, it’s so
                            second-nature you can be thinking about other stuff while you do it.</p>
                        <p>Habits are formed so that we can better user our cognition for other stuff.
                            The body knows its a daily task so it puts it into autopilot.</p>
                        <p>But because of the process they are formed, routine-&gt;triggers -&gt; reward, bad
                            habits can seem in as well. The body can’t tell the difference.</p>

                                How To Form Good Habits</a></p>
                        <p>To form good habits, you must have the right triggers, the same routine, and make sure
                            there’s a reward.</p>
                        <p>Experiments show
                            that triggers, also called visual cues or signs, are really important.</p>
                        <p>If you take enough of these aways, the habit won’t be
                            formed.</p>
                        <p>Eugene experienced this with his walk.</p>
                        <p>Also, they found that every morning, Eugene would get mad when his wife&nbsp;would leave
                            for work without saying anything to him. Even though he forgot why a couple minutes later,
                            that anger followed him for a long time.</p>
                        <p>By changing
                            one of the signs that are part of the routine, Eugene didn’t have the anger anymore. In this
                            case, they made his wife&nbsp;talk to him briefly before
                            she left, even though he would forget it minutes later.</p>
                        <p>For you, this could mean &nbsp;just making sure that&nbsp;small things like the route
                            you drive to the gym or the routine before you stretch is similar.</p>
                        <p>The final piece of habit formation is rewards and repeating.</p>
                        <p>Having an
                            expected reward at the end constantly is needed to start forming the habit into something
                            permanent. In Eugene’s card game experiment, this could be
                            as simple as a quick mental confirmation that you were right.</p>
                        <p>And, of course, repeat until it forms.</p>

                                Set Things Up To Be No-Effort</a></p>
                        <p>The most classic example is setting yourself up in the morning so that
                            working out is no-effort: your gym clothes are laid out right in front of you when you wake
                            up, your bag is packed and ready, and you’re ready to get
                            up and go.</p>
                        <p>It works. By eliminating the friction and work so you don’t become daunted or overwhelmed by
                            excuses or laziness, it can make things
                            a lot easier.</p>
                        <p>If you want to write more blog posts, having the computer and browser set up so that it’s
                            easy access to immediately log in and
                            start writing eliminates obstacles and barriers that allow your motivation to decline. An
                            example of this would be waiting 7 minutes for a computer to
                            boot up because you have an old computer.</p>

                        <p>Increasing the rewards and making sure you reward yourself each time you create a habit will
                            further cement the habit and motivate
                            you.</p>
                        <p>The reward doesn’t have to be related to the habit.</p>
                        <p>This video shows that once the habit is ingrained, you can keep doing it even if
                            you take away the reward.</p>

                        <p>Radio stations found that people are
                            much more likely to adopt and like a different song if it is played in between very
                            familiar, well-known songs.</p>
                        <p>Butchers had a hard time selling
                            intestines and liver until they packaged it as “the new steak” since people were familiar
                            with steak.</p>
                        <p>Gyms found that people were more likely to
                            keep paying for membership when people form relationships with the employees, go with
                            friends, or make friends at the gym. (source of all of these
                            come from the book Power of Habit)</p>
                        <p>People are more likely to adopt things that they are familiar with. Add new habits in between
                            a group of
                            familiar habits to adopt them.</p>
                        <p><strong>The key takeaway: Wrap a new habit you are trying to form within familiar routines. A
                                great example is to
                                form a place of friendship and a social community at the gym to go more
                                consistently.</strong></p>

                        <p>One of the biggest things they have found to
                            help with habit formation is finding a group of like-minded people you can meet with at
                            least weekly to hold yourself accountable, help you believe,
                            and develop habits together.</p>
                        <p>In the studies they examined, they have found that when all else fails, the one thing that
                            has helped them create
                            good habits is a social community.</p>

                                When All Else Fails have A Higher Calling or Purpose</a></p>
                        <p>Other than
                            social groups, the one other thing they found that got people through to forming good habits
                            was a higher purpose,&nbsp;calling, or a traumatic
                            personal event like a divorce or death that motivates them to change. While you can’t
                            perform the last one, you can do the others even if you’re not
                            religious.</p>
                        <p>In the book, they have a case study of a man who was addicted to crack and alcohol. Despite a
                            lot of treatment and years of work, he
                            still relapsed when he thought he was cured.</p>
                        <p>Although he was atheist, he was encouraged to look to a higher religious calling to help him.
                            He
                            looked to a higher outside force outside of his control (it wasn’t exactly a religious one.
                            Just some unknown force), despite believing it was
                            preposterous.</p>
                        <p>It actually helped him change his addiction.</p>
                        <p>Alcoholics Anonymous is a well known national organization. <a target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">It has 2 million members and 115,000 groups as of
                                2014.</a>&nbsp;The crazy thing is that it has one principle you must follow in its rules
                            that goes against any science: you must give yourself to a
                            religious or higher calling. Perhaps there is something here because it has helped many
                            people overcome their alcohol addiction.</p>
                        <p>Giving yourself
                            to a higher power that is out of your control may help with neurological networks in your
                            brain that give you greater belief, hope, and persistence to
                            keep going.</p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">
                                How To Improve&nbsp;Bad Habits</a></p>
                        <p>Bad habits can never be
                            erased from our neurological wiring once we obtain them. However, we can replace them so
                            that when we get the same triggers and signs (itchy fingers),
                            we do something other than what we were used to (biting our nails).</p>
                        <p>To break bad habits, you want to look to replace the&nbsp;routine&nbsp;with
                            good habits.</p>
                        <p>The book The Power of Habit has found that those who broke bad habits did so by keeping the
                            cues and rewards the same, but just
                            changing the routine.</p>
                        <p>So if you bite your nails, do something else with your hands instead. If you drink too much
                            soda, drink something else
                            instead. Reward yourself with the same feeling though: a pleasant sensation in your mouth
                            (seltzer water) or an easy feeling in your fingertips
                            (massage your fingers).</p>
                        <p>The message is simple: Keep the same reward and cues because you are used to them, but change
                            the routine.</p>
                        <p>A huge
                            part of habits is the craving. When the craving kicks in, change the routine so that you
                            work towards the same rewards with a different cue.</p>
                        <p>An
                            example would be: when you crave nicotine from smoking cigarettes, look to doing different
                            routines like nicotine patches.</p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">
                                Form Keystone Habits First</a></p>
                        <p>Keystone habits are habits that when formed, make it easier to form other habits. Therefore,
                            you want to form these
                            first.</p>
                        <p>One of the best keystone habits is a daily habit of exercise. I have found it useful to aim
                            low initially with a habit of just 10 or 15
                            minutes every day or every other day so I don’t burn out with a goal that is too big.</p>
                        <p>Exercise works great as a keystone habit because of <a target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">all the science</a> that has proven to start happening when
                            you become more healthy: you have more energy, you are happier, you get more done, and so
                            on.</p>
                        <h3><span>Keystone Habits List</span></h3>
                        <p>Charles doesn’t list many other keystone habits in the book, but based on his principles,
                            these may be other examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>yoga.</li>
                            <li>weight lifting.</li>
                            <li>exercise (jogging).</li>
                            <li>goal journaling.</li>
                            <li>food
                                journaling.</li>
                            <li>gratitude journaling.</li>
                            <li>making your bed.</li>
                            <li>healthy breakfasts.</li>
                            <li>visualization exercises.</li>
                            <li>celebrating
                                your wins in a daily journal.</li>
                            <li>planning out and prioritizing&nbsp;every week.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To illustrate, food journaling is useful because it
                            helps you eat better, which improves your health, which improves your focus and energy, it
                            improves how much you can exercise, it extends your life,
                            and changes your long-term food routines.</p>

                                The Baby-Step Method</a></p>
                        <p>This method
                            is exactly as it sounds. Have infinitely small goals.</p>
                        <p>I have constantly been burnt out after setting large goals. Add that on with wanting to
                            over-achieve, and you burn yourself out.</p>
                        <p>Example: I plan to go to the gym for an hour after not going for over a year. I get there,
                            feel great,
                            an hour is up, and then I want to “over-achieve” and end up staying 2 more hours. I end up
                            feeling alright afterwards but the next 2 weeks shows that
                            I have somehow been burnt out: I don’t return to the gym again.</p>
                        <p>Any fitness guru will tell you that consistency beats killing yourself once a
                            month or once a week.</p>
                        <p>What has worked for me is baby-steps: I set a mini-goal of 10 minutes at the gym every other
                            day. It’s so small and easy
                            that I can do it and it helps me stay consistent.</p>
                        <p>You can’t expect to jump from working out zero times a week to immediately working out 7
                            times
                            a week for 3 hours each.</p>

                        <p>Jerry Seinfield is one of the most
                            famous comedians in history. What people would be surprised to know is that he is also very
                            financially successful, with a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of
                                around $820 million</a>,
                            primarily through re-runs of his show Seinfield (one of, if not the, most successful sitcom
                            in history).</p>
                        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An article was written from someone
                                who asked him for advice.</a> Apparently, he creates a habit by having a calendar and
                            crossing off the day if he does what he’s supposed to each day.
                            Over time, the chain of X’s gets longer and you feel bad and don’t want to break it.</p>
                        <p>He recommends using a calendar that shows the whole year on
                            one page and marking the X’s with a red marker.</p>

                        <p>Habits never really disappear.</p>
                        <p>Once you
                            program them in, they will re-emerge if you set up your life to awaken them. This can be
                            good and bad depending on which habits you form.</p>
                        <p>The
                            book <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Power of Habits</a> goes into
                            extensive more detail on
                            the scientific studies about this, but it is clear that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>habits can be created</li>
                            <li>habits can be ignored and changed</li>
                            <li>bad habits
                                can be&nbsp;eliminated</li>

                        <p>Understanding the basic concept of routine -&gt; reward can help you remove or create a
