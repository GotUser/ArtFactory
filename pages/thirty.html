                            </a></p>
                        <p>Ready to <a>make this year your best</a> yet?</p>
                        <p>Then you’re in the right place.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know about you, but every year I try to <a>do a little better than the last</a>. We
                            learn new
                            things, make mistakes, experience setbacks, and have breakthroughs. Life often seems like
                            the
                            ebb and flow of a wave, however, amid all of this chaos, if you try hard enough you can
                            manage
                            to make a lot of progress. So much so that you turn around and can hardly believe how far
                            you
                            came in a single year.</p>
                        <p>But <a>it takes work</a>. And you need to be willing to do the work from the moment <a>the
                                New
                                Year</a> starts if you want to create a real transformation in your life.</p>

                            <p>Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>There’s nothing like starting the New Year off by front-loading a ton of momentum to get your
                            year
                            started in the right direction. That’s where the idea of the thirty-day growth challenge
                            comes
                            from.</p>
                        <p>By no means do you <em>have</em> to do everything below, it’s more of a framework, but if you
                            use it
                            as a guide and apply yourself to completing it, you have the ability to generate a huge
                            amount
                            of momentum towards your goals this year.</p>
                        <p>Also, keep in mind that <a>perfection is pretty much impossible</a>. Things will come up and
                            there
                            will be days where you just can’t make that day’s objective happen. That’s okay, I’d shoot
                            for
                            an eighty percent completion rate. If you can do that, you’re off to a great start for the
                            year.
                        </p>
                        <p>I’ve included some “free” days partly for that reason, so you can use them to make up for
                            missed
                            objectives. However, it’s also important to go occasionally without the pressure of having
                            to
                            complete a new objective hanging over your head, hence the occasional day break.</p>
                        <p>Here’s the 30-day growth challenge:</p>
                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">
                                Week 1
                            </a></p>
                        <p>Week one is all about developing <a>important habits</a> and establishing things that will
                            serve as
                            the framework for getting the most out of your day over the next year:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Day 1: </strong><a><strong>Leave last year behind</strong></a><strong> (and
                                    commit
                                    to no expectations)</strong>: It’s important mentally to leave the year behind.
                                A lot happened, I’m sure, and you probably had your fair share of challenges, but if you
                                hope to make progress this year you need to leave this all behind. This could be
                                something as simple as taking a short walk on the beach and allowing yourself to let the
                                past rest behind you.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 2: </strong><a><strong>Set goals</strong></a><strong> for the year (or
                                    reevaluate them if you already have)</strong>. What do you want to accomplish
                                this year? You won’t get very far if you’re not clear on what you want.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 3: Break those down into quarterly goals and use a
                                </strong><a><strong>weekly
                                        accountability system</strong></a><strong> to track your

                            <li><strong>Day 4: </strong><a><strong>List important assets</strong></a><strong> you need
                                    to
                                    accomplish those goals</strong>. Chances are, you don’t have everything you need
                                to accomplish your goals. Make a list and figure how you’ll acquire the assets you need
                                to do that (such as skills, new contacts, etc.).</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 5: Make a </strong><a><strong>vision board</strong></a>. I know, sounds
                                hoaky –
                                but it’s not. Don’t pass this one up! (Even if it takes more than a day.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 6: </strong><a><strong>Start a journal</strong></a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 7: Free.</strong></li>

                            </a></p>
                        <p>Week two is about the outward. It’s about optimizing your environment to maximize your focus
                            and productivity:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Day 8: </strong><a><strong>Wake up thirty minutes earlier</strong></a>. Even if
                                you don’t do anything with it, rising early makes you feel great and puts you in the
                                right state of mind for the day ahead.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 9: </strong><a><strong>Design a morning routine</strong></a>. Take it one
                                step further and design a morning routine that jumpstarts your day.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 10: </strong><a><strong>Adopt a nightly ritual</strong></a>. Like the
                                morning routine, but this is all about optimizing your sleep and well-being by placing
                                you in the right physical and mental state of being before retiring for the day.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 11: Minimize or get rid of T.V.</strong> I know, you can’t do without
                                <em>Game of Thrones</em>. That’s okay, as long as you reduce your T.V. consumption down
                                to just a few hours a week you’re good.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Day 12: Do a smartphone/app cleaning</strong>. Chances are, you have a ton of
                                apps you really don’t need or which distract you regularly but bring you little value.
                                Time to do away with all of it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 13: Cleanse your </strong><a><strong>social</strong></a>. Social is one of
                                the biggest time sinks and a constant source of distractions. Reduce the number of sites
                                you’re on, who you follow, and weed out the bad associations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day 14: Free.</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Week three is about the inner game of optimizing your performance to increase your
                            creativity,
                            performance, focus, and reduce stress:</p>

                                                    five minutes</strong>. Preferably, make this a
                                                daily habit.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Day 16: Try a </strong><a><strong>brain
                                                        game</strong></a>. These are great for
                                                optimizing your cognitive functions.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Day 17: Adopt a </strong><a><strong>mindfulness

                                                </strong>It’s important you find a method that works for
                                                you so you’ll be excited to work out.</li>

                                                </strong>There needs to be a sense of order and logic to

                        <p>Week four is about growing your knowledge, skills, and other assets. If you took my advice
                            earlier and listed important assets you need to acquire to accomplish your goals for the
                            year, that’s a great place to look for ideas on the kinds of things you need to learn,
                            develop, and acquire:</p>

                                            <li><strong>Day 23: Start listening to podcasts. </strong>Unlike books,
                                                which require your undivided attention, podcasts are great because you

                                            <li><strong>Day 25: Do one thing you’re afraid of. </strong>The ability to
                                                consistently <a>step outside of your comfort zone</a> is a skill that
                                                can and should be developed now as it will serve you in everything you
                                                do.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Day 27: </strong><a><strong>Reach out to one
                                                        person</strong></a><strong> that can move your career
                                                    forward</strong>. This is all about building professional
                                                connections. Most of us have a hard time bringing ourselves to make that
                                                initial contact, let alone build entire new relationships with people.
                                                This is about taking that initial step, everything else tends to happen
                                                naturally from there, because we’re motivated to continue.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Day 28: Perform </strong><a><strong>an act of
                                                        kindness</strong></a>. You’ll notice this doesn’t seem to fit
                                                with the theme of this week. However, I’ve found that most of us have
                                                lost touch with (or never knew) the power of helping others without
                                                expecting anything in return. This knowledge, and the understanding that
                                                you always have the ability to exercise it, doesn’t just make you
                                                happier and more fulfilled, it can serve you in your career in a big
                                                way. Such acts of kindness are the perfect way to start off a long and
                                                beautiful business relationship or personal connection.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Day 29: Free. </strong>If you missed an objective at some point,
                                                now is the perfect time to make it up!</li>

                        <p>The Near Year is a chance to start fresh and do something you have never done before. But if
                            your goal is to make real progress, then you have to be willing to do what’s necessary. It
                            takes <a>hard work</a>, <a>persistence</a> to make this thirty-day challenge happen. But if
                            you do? You’ll be strapped to a rocket and ready to make this the best year of your entire
                            life.</p>
                        <p>Whether you follow this thirty-day challenge to the ‘T’ or adapt your own, use this as a
                            framework for creating <a>the change you want to see in your life</a> this year.</p>
