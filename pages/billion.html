                        </b>
                        <p>You are a thoroughly good person.You deserve a wonderful life, full of
                            success, happiness, joy, and excitement.You are entitled to have happy relationships,
                            excellent health, meaningful work, and financial independence. These are your birthright.
                            This is what your life is meant to include.<br><br>You are engineered
                            for success and designed to have high levels of self-esteem, self-respect, and personal
                            pride. You are extraordinary; there has never been anyone exactly like you in all the
                            history of mankind on earth.You have absolutely amazing untapped talents and abilities that,
                            when properly unleashed and applied, can bring you everything you could ever want in
                            life.<br><br>You are living at the greatest time in all of human
                            history.You are surrounded by abundant opportunities that you can take advantage of to
                            realize your dreams. The only real limits on what you can be, do, or have are the limits you
                            place on yourself by your own thinking.Your future is virtually unlimited.<br>
                            <li><b>GET REAL!</b>
                                <p>How did you react to the preceding three paragraphs? You
                                    probably had two responses. First, you liked what they said, and your fondest wish
                                    was for them to be true for you. But your second response was probably one of
                                    skepticism and disbelief. Even though you deeply desire to live a wonderfully
                                    healthy, happy, prosperous life, when you read those words, your doubts and fears
                                    arose immediately to remind you of reasons why these dreams and goals may not be
                                    possible for you.Well, join the crowd!<br><br>This is exactly
                                    how I felt many years ago. Even though I wanted to be a big success in life, I was
                                    unskilled, uneducated, and unemployed. I had no idea what I could do to improve my
                                    situation. I felt trapped between big ideas on the one hand and limited resources
                                    and opportunities on the other. Then I discovered a series of remarkable principles
                                    that have been responsible for all the great successes and achievements of the ages,
                                    and my life changed forever.<br><br>After proving these laws
                                    and principles in my own life, I began speaking, and training others to apply the
                                    same ideas. Since then, I have given more than two thousand talks and seminars as
                                    long as four days in length, in 24 countries, to a total of more than two million
                                    participants. Most of them were also skeptical when they first heard these ideas of
                                    optimism and possibility, until they learned what you are going to learn in the
                                    pages ahead. It changed their lives, as it will change yours.
                            <li><b>THE GREAT PRINCIPLE</b>
                                <p>Perhaps the most important mental and spiritual principle ever
                                    discovered is that <b><em>you become what you think about most of the
                                            time</em></b>.Your outer world is very much a mirror image of your inner
                                    world.What is going on <b><em>outside</em></b> of you is a reflection of what is
                                    going in <b><em>inside</em></b> of you.You can tell the inner condition of a person
                                    by looking at the outer conditions of his or her life. And it cannot be otherwise.
                            <li><b>THOUGHTS ARE THINGS</b>
                                <p>Your mind is extraordinarily powerful. Your thoughts control
                                    and determine almost everything that happens to you. They can raise or lower your
                                    heart rate, improve or interfere with your digestion, change the chemical
                                    composition of your blood, and help you to sleep or keep you awake at
                                    night.<br><br>Your thoughts can make you happy or sad,
                                    sometimes in an instant. They can make you alert and aware, or distracted and
                                    depressed. They can make you popular or unpopular, confident or insecure, positive
                                    or negative. Your thoughts can make you feel powerful or powerless, a victim or a
                                    victor, a hero or a coward. <br><br> In your material life,
                                    your thoughts can make you a success or a failure, prosperous or poverty-stricken,
                                    respected or ignored. Your thoughts, and the actions that they trigger, determine
                                    your whole life. And the best news of all is that they are completely under your own
                                    control.<br>
                            <li><b>THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, AND DESIRES</b>
                                <p>You are a complex bundle of thoughts, feelings, attitudes,
                                    desires, images, fears, hopes, doubts, opinions, and ambitions, each of them
                                    constantly changing, sometimes from second to second. Each of these elements of your
                                    personality affects the others, sometimes in unpredictable ways.Your entire life is
                                    the result of the intertwining and interconnecting of these factors.<br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour thoughts trigger images and pictures, and the emotions that go
                                    with them. These images and emotions trigger attitudes and actions.Your actions then
                                    have consequences and results that determine what happens to you.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIf you think about success and confidence, you will feel strong and
                                    competent, and you will perform better at whatever you attempt. If you think about
                                    making mistakes or being embarrassed, you will perform poorly, no matter how good
                                    you really are.<br><br>Pictures and images, from your
                                    imagination or from the external influences, produce ideas, emotions, and attitudes
                                    that correspond to them. They then trigger actions that bring about certain results
                                    and outcomes.The <em>thought</em> of a person or situation can cause you to
                                    instantly feel happy or sad, elated or angry, loving or lonely.<br>
                            <li><b>ATTITUDES, ACTIONS,AND EMOTIONS</b>
                                <p>Your attitudes, positive or negative, constructive or
                                    destructive, lead to corresponding images, emotions, and actions that affect your
                                    life and relationships. Your attitudes, in turn, are based on your previous
                                    experiences and your basic premises about how things are supposed to
                                    be.<br><br>Your actions trigger the emotions and attitudes
                                    that go with them. By the Law of Reversibility, you can actually act your way into
                                    feeling in a manner consistent with the action. By acting as if you were already
                                    happy, positive, and confident, you soon begin to feel that way on the inside. And
                                    your actions are under your direct control, whereas your emotions are
                                    not.<br><br>In and of themselves, the outer aspects of your
                                    life are <em>neutral.</em> It is only the <em>meaning</em> that you give to them
                                    that determines your attitudes, opinions, emotions, and reactions to them. If you
                                    change your thinking about any part of your life, you will change how you feel and
                                    behave in that area. And since only you can decide what to think, you have the
                                    ability to take complete control over your life.<br>
                            <li><b>QUESTION YOUR BELIEFS</b>
                                <p>The Law of Belief says:<em> Whatever you believe, with
                                        conviction, becomes your reality.</em>You always act in a manner consistent with
                                    your deepest and most intensely held beliefs, whether they are true or not. And all
                                    your beliefs are learned. At one time, you did not have them.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspYour beliefs largely determine your reality.You do not believe what you
                                    <em>see</em>; you rather <em>see</em> what you already believe. You can have
                                    life-enhancing beliefs that make you happy and optimistic, or you can have negative
                                    beliefs about yourself and your potential that act as roadblocks to the realization
                                    of everything that is truly possible for you.<br><br>The most
                                    harmful beliefs you can have are your <em>self-limiting beliefs.</em> These are
                                    beliefs about yourself and your potential that hold you back. Most of them are not
                                    true. Most of them are the result of information you have accepted without question,
                                    often from early childhood. Even if it is completely untrue, if you <em>believe</em>
                                    yourself to be limited in areas such as achieving wonderful health and happiness and
                                    earning a lot of money, that will become your truth. As the author Richard Bach in
                                    his book <em>Illusions</em> wrote, 'Argue for your limitations and sure enough,
                                    they're yours.'<br>
                            <li><b>YOU ARE A LIVING MAGNET</b>
                                <p>The Law of Attraction says that you are a <em>'living
                                        magnet'</em> and that <em>you invariably attract into your life the people,
                                        ideas, opportunities, and circumstances in harmony with your dominant
                                        thoughts.</em><br><br>When you think positive,
                                    optimistic, loving, and successful thoughts, you create a <em>force field</em> of
                                    magnetism that attracts, like iron filings to a magnet, the very things you are
                                    thinking about. This law explains why it is that you don't have to be concerned
                                    where your good is going to come from. If you can keep your mind clearly focused on
                                    what you want, and refrain from thinking about what you <em>don't</em> want, you
                                    will <em>attract</em> everything you need to achieve your goals, exactly when you
                                    are ready. Change your thinking and you change your life.<br>
                            <li><b>THE ONLY REAL MEASURE</b>
                                <p>Bertrand Russell, the English philosopher, once said, 'The
                                    very best proof that something can be done is that others have already done it.' In
                                    the New Testament, Jesus taught the way to measure the truth of any principle: 'By
                                    their fruits, ye shall know them.'<br><br>In other words, the
                                    only question you need to ask about any idea is, 'Does it work?' Does it bring about
                                    the results that you desire? Milton Friedman, the Nobel prizewinning economist,
                                    said, 'The only true measure of a theory or idea is your ability to make accurate
                                    predictions of the future based on it.'<br><br>The good news
                                    is that the ideas and principles you are about to learn have been tested and proven
                                    in the lives and experiences of millions of people. In themselves, like any
                                    principles of nature, they are <em>neutral</em>. Nature plays no favorites. Nature
                                    treats everyone alike. Whatever seed you plant in the ground, nature will
                                    grow.Whatever <em>thought seeds</em> you plant in your mind, nature will grow as
                                    well. It is entirely up to you.<br>
                            <li><b>CHOOSE YOUR THOUGHTS</b>
                                <p>Successful people are those who think more effectively than
                                    unsuccessful people. They approach their lives, relationships, goals, problems, and
                                    experiences differently from others. They sow better seeds, and as a result they
                                    reap better lives. If you learn to think and act like other successful, happy,
                                    healthy, and prosperous people, you will soon enjoy the kind of lives they do. When
                                    you change your thinking, you change your life.
