                                Introduction
                            </a></p>

                        <p>
                            One of my favorite quotes is by Jim Rohn: “You are the average of the five people you
                            spend the most time with.” These words opened my eyes to the fact that the people we
                            hang out with, the people we call friends, they all have an influence on the decisions
                            we make in life, and therefore the success we have (or don’t have).
                            <br /><br />Unfortunately, not everyone pushes us to be better. Some people stop us from
                            following our dreams or talk us out of taking a risk, and we don’t always realize that
                            it’s happening. So it’s important to be aware and consciously choose who we spend time
                            with, to limit spending time with toxic people—like these five personalities you should
                            avoid when chasing goals.

                        </p>

                                1. The Complainers
                            </a></p>

                        <p>
                            Complainers are people who are always complaining about how bad their life or job or
                            whatever is. They constantly whine about everything but never do anything about it.
                            <br /><br />
                            Being around a complainer can take a toll on you—maybe you begin to join in on the
                            complaints, and before you know it, you adopt their same way of negative thinking. That
                            pessimism is contagious. Which is why you should think twice before sitting down with a
                            complainer.

                        </p>

                                2. The Entitled
                            </a></p>

                        <p>
                            These are the people who feel like they are entitled to certain things in life, like
                            they do not have to work for anything, that the people around them owe them something.
                            They are also the ones who will try to talk you out of following your dreams.
                            <br /><br />
                            This mindset can be deadly to a person trying to be successful. It blocks your
                            determination and can kill your motivation in a heartbeat. Know this: You, or anyone
                            else, are not entitled to anything. If you want the good life, you have to create it.

                        </p>


                        <p> <a href="#about2" class="main-button">
                                3. The Conformers
                            </a></p>

                        <p>
                            Conformers are the most popular of all. They are the ones who conform to the limits set
                            on them. They do not have any dreams they are chasing after, and they are not doing
                            something that goes against the status quo. They are simply living like robots—waking
                            up, working 40 hours a week at a job they hate, going home, sleeping and doing it all
                            over again.
                            <br /><br />
                            There are many people who are content with this, and that is perfectly fine. But a
                            person who is following their dreams simply cannot conform to the average life. So while
                            working your full-time job, put in the extra effort on the side to start building toward
                            something that’s more in line with your dreams. And eventually you will be able to leave
                            your day job to pursue your passion full time.

                                4. The Party Animals
                            </a></p>

                        <p>
                            They’re the one who’s planning happy hours five days a week, the one who lives to go out
                            every night. Sure, the party animal might be fun, but beware—they can distract you from
                            your dreams.
                            <br /><br />
                            Don’t get me wrong, you should take time to relax and clear your head on occasion, but
                            bar hopping is not the solution and it’s not going to get you the life you’re after. By
                            making partying a priority, you’re distracting yourself and breaking focus on your
                            goals—things bigger than dollar beers and half-price apps. In order to grow as a person,
                            you have to grow up first.

                        </p>

                                5. The Doubters
                            </a></p>

                        <p>
                            Doubters can be downers—they will listen to your big dreams, but they will be the first
                            ones to tell you they don’t think it is a good idea or not to get your hopes up. They
                            are the ones who believe you have to “be somebody” in order to do something extravagant.
                            <br /><br />
                            As somebody who is chasing their dreams, this can be very discouraging, so identifying
                            the doubters in your group will be beneficial to you and your success in the future.
                            Likewise, it is extremely important to keep supportive people around you, people who
                            encourage you and lift your spirits when you are losing motivation.
                            <br /><br />
                            So, surround yourself with people who will support and encourage you to chase your
                            dreams, through the good and the bad. Your success depends on it.
